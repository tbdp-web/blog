## 1. Introduction

Reciprocity is the heart and soul of a society that is beneficial in nature to all of its members. If every interaction is a trade of mutual benefits, both in the recognition of autonomy and the giving of value, or a proportionate reaction to harm done, human beings will automatically, due to the forces of social and game theoretic development, form a society that cannot help but be beneficial to all involved, and which is constructed along the lines of a peer-to-peer network of mutual trade and consideration, equal in rights and consideration. This is because, if every interaction must be mutually beneficial and it is only harm — violation of positive reciprocity — that is met with proportional harm — negative reciprocity — then there will be no subjegation of one person to another, and no slavery, but all will be free to organize with each other according to what benefits each individual, maximizing the good of all.

Equality of rights and mutual benefit of all is not enough to make a society worth living in, however. Each member of a society must also be in possession of their autonomy as an individual, to chart their own course, pursue well-being, virtue, and flourishing according to their own reason, and not subordinated to any other person. Even if there is a single, objectively correct standard for virtue in human beings, which is the extent and total of all that is relevant in determining whether someone is flourishing or virtuous — and this is not the case, as there are (diverse) individual virtues — that would not mean that the removal of the autonomy of the individual, separate from other individuals or the collective, would enable it. Subordination, for the individual's "own good" or not, kills the individual's ability to choose their own character (which eliminates any virtue in living any specific way, as it does not develop the mind or the character, and the actions lose their reward) exercise their own reason (which is crucial to one's life and existence as a human being instead of a pack animal for the use and maintenence of others), and pursue their own flourishing (because being at the mercy of others means one is at the mercy of those whose interests necessarily do not always aline with yours, and who do not have all the information oneself does concerning one's own flourishing). It smothers in its sleep the possibility of virtuous character and flourishing in the individual. 

Therefore, it is my project in this essay to lay out a succinct and concise defense of a self-interested (egoistic) ethic centered around two fundamental principles: autonomy and reciprocity.

## 2. Reciprocity

### 2.1. Why Reciprocity

Autonomy in one's own life and affairs, as I have argued in the introduction, is the key ingredient in being able to live one's life in the best way possible, especially when had in conjunction with a  non-hierarchical, non-authoritarian society of mutual aid and mutually beneficial trade. Therefore, the primary good that one should seek (if one wishes to prosper) to motivate others to respect through positive reciprocity and prevent others from taking away through negative reciprocity will be one's own autonomy.

Autonomy is not the only thing we can and should use positive and negative reciprocity to promote, however. We should use it to ensure that all actions are mutually beneficial to both parties (and as equally beneficial as possible), whether that is through mutual trade or mutual aid, that each interaction is on a level playing field of moral consideration, so that no one can exercise undue authority over another, and to ensure that voluntary cooperation is fostered.

Why use reciprocity, and not the unilateral force of a state? To attempt to establish, by force and from above, an order that respects your autonomy, is to institute a hierarchy in society that will necessarily be detrimental to your own autonomy in the long run, as your autonomy will ultimately end up subordinated to whatever institution one constructed to operate above you and the rest of society. Worse, a race to capture that apparatus will begin, and others will be disinscentivized to care about your autonomy, as you did not care about theirs. Therefore, reciprocity is the best strategy to achieve autonomy, because it works on a mutual, horizontal basis, instead of introducing any hierarchy and authority into society, and it directly incentivizes others to respect your autonomy by respecting theirs, instead of by threat of force (at least, purely).

### 2.2. Positive Reciprocity

If one is to seek one's own gain autonomy, promoting a society that maximizes autonomy for all, and the reciprocity of all interactions including reciprocal respect for autonomy, both by one's words and by one's matching deeds, is wise. A society that respects the autonomy of only a few, or compromises on autonomy, for some or all, will find it easy to shrink the list of those who "deserve" autonomy or the range of everyone's autonomy, after all. Furthermore, if one respects the autonomy of others, and interacts with them in a positive way, one is much more likely to be able to convince those others to respect one's own autonomy, and to interact with oneself in mutually beneficial and positive ways. This is **positive reciprocity**: if I respect your autonomy and trade with you honestly, fairly, and beneficially, I do so out of good feeling, but also out of the expectation and hope that you will do the same.

In order that I not be taken advantage of, however, if you do not return the positive cooperation I offer you, then reciprocity is broken, and I will cease to cooperate with you as well, ceasing to respect your autonomy and to give benefits to you when you do not respect mine and do likewise for me. Thus I motivate you to respond to my cooperation with like cooperation by the hopes on your part that I will cooperate with you, and you likewise motivate me to cooperate with you in the hopes that you will continue to cooperate with me. This is what is called a Nash equilibrium: because we both follow the same strategy, it is optimal for both of us to continue this strategy in most cases; otherwise, we loose benefits.

### 2.3. Negative Reciprocity

In a more extreme case of ceasing cooperation, we have what is called **negative reciprocity**: if you actively violate my autonomy, and interact with me in a way that is unfair and deleterious to me, it is in my interest to repay that with like and proportional disregard and harm, so as to motivate you to cease doing that, and it is likewise in your interest to commit to the same strategy, to motivate me to avoid harming you. Importantly, in the case of negative reciprocity, one can only prove one's commitment to this strategy of repaying harm with harm and unfairness with unfairness by action if someone else has already committed a harm or unfairness towards you, otherwise you would be the one ceasing cooperation first, so it is important to *verbally* post one's commitment to this strategy in order to make it known as a deterrant, whereas with positive reciprocity one can simply demonstrate with actions. Therefore, it is often beneficial to have explicit agreements or contracts with others concernign what will cause each of you to engage in negative reciprocity and to what degree, and to form mutual associations to multiply the force of such a commitment. Thus a "law" of sorts, built in game theoretic committment strategies, forms in the egalitarian world of mutual reciprocal interaction.

Proportionality is also crucially important when engaging in negative reciprocity: after all, if one engages in a grossly disproportionate act of retribution, others in the social mesh of mutual reciprocity that is the "community," including and especially the ones you reacted against, are far more likely to view this as a *new* violation of mutual respect for other's autonomy, instead of a proper response. Meanwhile, if you stick to something in like kind and proportional, it will be clearer what it is a response to, and that it is not an overpayment. This is how one avoids blood feuds and the destruction of the social mesh that comes with such things.

### 2.4. Reciprocity Is the Best Game Theoretic Strategy

This direct and rational benefit to reciprocity in both its positive and negative forms is borne out even on the abstract, mathematical front: the best strategy in an interated Prisoner's Dilemma game,  at least when pitted against another strategy that is non-random, where two players have to play with each other over and over with memory of how the previous rounds went, or where a player's reputation follows them through the game, is tit-for-tat[^8], which is an algorithmic form of reciprocity. The Prisoner's Dilemma is a good simplified representation of what it is like in the social world because it is a game that represents all three states of social interaction: mutualism, war, and theft: if two players cooperate they get the largest overall reward, to reperesent mutual trade, and if they both refuse to cooperate they both get the least possible reward, representing war, but if one cooperates and the other does not, representing theft, the one who defected gets a higher reward than even in cooperation, and the other gets nothing.

### 2.5. Reciprocity is A Good Evolutionary and Psychological Strategy

So far, I have described the motivations behind positive and negative reciprocation in terms of pure economic self-interst when taking into account social existence. However, human beings (and primates in general) are creatures that have evolved in a social context, to engage in mutual aid and association, society and language, in order to overcome obsticles and increase our fitness as a species: "These results indicate a significant independent contribution of  reciprocity to human and primate helping behaviour. Furthermore, similar effect sizes in humans and primates speak against cognitive constraints on reciprocity. This study is the first to use meta-analyses to  quantify these effects on human helping and to directly compare humans  and other primates."[^9] Our ability to engage with each other in society, and our instincts for mutual aid, are part of what have made us such a successful species: although Neanderthals were stronger and better adapted to the environemnt than us, we outcompeted them. According to some scientists, this might have been in part because of our ability to work with each other.[^1] Why should we not continue in that winning strategy? To quote from the very clear explanation on Wikipedia:

> [Cultural anthropologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_anthropology) support this idea in what they call the "web of indebtedness" where  reciprocity is viewed as an adaptive mechanism to enhance survival.[[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(social_psychology)#cite_note-12) Within this approach, reciprocity creates an interdependent environment where labor is divided so that humans may be more efficient. For  example, if one member of the group cares for the children while another member hunts for food for the group, each member has provided a service and received one in return. Each member can devote more time and  attention to his or her allotted task and the whole group benefits. This meant that individuals could give away resources without actually  giving them away. Through the rule of reciprocity, sophisticated systems of aid and trade were possible bringing immense benefits to the  societies that utilized them.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(social_psychology)#cite_note-:1-1) Given the benefits of reciprocity at the societal level, it is not  surprising that the norm has persisted and dictates our present  cognition and behavior.[^10]

[^10]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(social_psychology)#An_adaptive_mechanism

Reciprocal, cooperative strategies in fact emerge all throughout nature, because of the very selfish and competitive properties of natural selection.[^7] Since the best strategy for repeated interactions with others in the context of a society of individuals, as demonstrated above, and by economists[^2] and biologists[^3], is reciprocity (in both positive and negative varieties), it seems that humans have evolved to follow reciprocal strategies — and therefore to get positive psychological rewards for doing so. That is why we have trust, sympathy, suspicion, and so on. This makes the payoff of following reciprocal stategies much higher, because doing so makes one feel happier about oneself and one's own character, and also because it motivates others to cooperate more even than a conscious game theoretic caculation on their part would.[^4] [^5] This applies to both positive and negative reciprocation: it seems a well-established law of human psychology, that those of us humans who plan to live in socieities with others would do well to take note of and to act in accordance with, that human beings will take reciprocal action (repay kindness with kindness and harm with harm) even when it is not in their direct self-interest to do so, because they feel it necessary, as a way of satisfying psychological feelings and therefore being happier:

> There is considerable evidence that a substantial fraction of people behave according to this dictum [of reciprocity]: People repay gifts and take revenge even in interactions with complete strangers and even if it is costly for them and yields neither present nor future material rewards. Our notion of reciprocity is thus very different from kind or hostile responses in repeated interactions that are solely motivated by future material gains.[^6]

### 2.6. The Rules of Reciprocity

Thus we have four reasons to adhere to reciprocity in our interactions with others:

1. It motivates others to aid us and avoid harming us through purely rational means.
2. It is best game theoretic strategy when interacting with others in a social situation where one can gain reputation and interact with people multiple times.
3. It is a strategy that has been successful throughout nature and also in human history, and is part of what makes us successful as a species.
4. It gives us psychological benefits (friendship, trust, etc.) and are actually more advantageous than the assumption of pure rationality suggests because of our evolutinoary heritage.

From the discussion above, we can derive three "*rules of reciprocity*", in order of importance:

1. **DO NOT ACT TOWARDS OTHERS IN A MANNER ONE WOULD NOT LIKE TO BE ACTED TOWARDS ONESELF, UNTIL THEY STOP DOING LIKEWISE.** This leads to refraining from actions that are harmful to others, which is extremely important: it is far more important to a rational individual not to be stolen from, or killed, or maimed, or harmed, than it is to have things that would be "nice" done for them. Even a poor person will be more devistated by someone stealing their only loaf of bread than they will be helped by someone giving them a new one.
2. **REPLY IN KIND TO THE HARMS OTHERS IMPOSE ON ONESELF, AND MAKE IT KNOWN AND AGREED UPON AHEAD OF TIME THAT ONE WILL DO SO, AND PREFERABLY IN WHAT PROPORTION.** This leads to a society of voluntary and mutual contracts and associations for defense, in order to establish an understanding and means of discouraging those who violate the autonomy of others. Importantly, the proportionality proviso requires that individuals do not reply to a slight in social situations with a violation of autonomy, or a small violation in autonomy with a large one.
3. **ACT TOWARDS OTHERS IN A MANNER THAT ONE WOULD LIKE OTHERS TO ACT TOWARDS ONSELF, UNTIL THEY STOP DOING LIKEWISE.** This leads to trying to engage in mutually (and hopefully equally) benefical interactions in all spheres of society, and granting aid to others if it can be expected that aid may be returned in kind.

These rules can be overriden by specific concerns of self-interest, in cases where the benefit to one of doing something that violates one of these rules is far greater than the benefit the rules grant, but being known to adhere to these rules consistently and generally is an important part of reciprocity working and social trust building up, so it should be clear that these rules should dominate most situations, the vast middle swath of payoffs. The lower the rule is on this list, however, the easier I think it is to overrule.

Additionally, it must be remembered that these rules are based primarily and ultimately on the hope of reciprocation in actions, so altruism is not implied even by the third rule, which sounds like the golden rule: for while the golden rule implies giving to others with no thought to the self and no expectation of return, the third rule here is motivated only by a hope that in aiding others, they will aid onself, and is overriden by self interest when necessary. Thus, if others refuse to cooperate, then, because this is reciprocation and not altruism, your own cooperation should stop as well.

## 3. Autonomy

I have spoken at length about the virtues of autonomy and how one can use reciprocity to preseve autonomy and a society that is conducive to it. What exactly is autonomy, however?

I define autonomy as one's freedom to act in the sphere which effects only oneself and those who want to interact with you: freedom of association, freedom to direct one's own life, freedom to engage in trades and contracts with one's fellows, freedom to control one's own body and the motions thereof (labor time). Any freedom to act in a way that encroches on other's autonomy is not itself autonomy, but a violation of other's autonomy. Thus one's freedom to act increases when you can violate other's autonomy only by decreasing their freedom, and it does not constitute in an increase of one's own autonomy.

Additionally, autonomy has an element of independance: one does not unilaterally depend on the charity of others to survive, making one an inert and uncreative being, either at the mercy of others or subjecting them to your mercy, but produces value of one's own contributions of value to give them benefits in return for the benefits they give you, so that one is not a source of net loss of value for others, but of net gain for everyone, as both sides gain in interacting with you. This rules out, as an important mode of life that one might want to ensure through reciprocity, any sort of long-term parasitism as a lifestyle, while preserving the possibility that one might need to lose one's independance for awhile even if one pursues it as one should if one desires to prosper in life.

## 4. Property and Autonomy

Property can be seen as an extension of autonomy in two ways: both as a way to have resources at one's own disposal, for labor, self-sustinence, and other exercises of autonomy, that are seperable from the community or the rule of others and that you have sole choice of direction over, and as an extension of the past labor time invested in certain objects, the theft of which therefore undermines the autonomy of the labor that was done to modify that object, since now instead of being done for the rational purposes of the individual who did the labor, and therefore being autonomous, it turns out to have been done for the purposes of the thief, and thereby is no longer autonomous labor but servitude.

Importantly, it is less profitable for individuals to respect property that is the not being used by another individual to guarantee and extend their autonomy in their own labor and range of action, and is instead being used to dominate and lower the autonomy of others — by making them supplicants or debtors for instance — because it is directly undermining the amount of autonomy in society and the autonomy of those expected to respect it, so their respect of that extension of the autonomy of the property holder decreases their own autonomy, and if it does so severely enough, it is no longer beneficial to do so at all. Furthermore, absentee property, property that is not directly used by a person and therefore crucial in ensuring and expanding the sphere of their free action separate from other individuals, is of less interest and importance to the autonomy of an individual themselves, because it effects their autonomy *only* in the second factor by which property is a component of autonomy, past labor, and not the first. Therefore, everyone has less of an interest in respecting others' absentee property precisely because they have less of a direct interest in others respecting their own.

Furthermore, again, direct self-interest can overcome reciprocity, meaning that theft and squatting can be engaged in rationally even in the absence of the foregoing considerations, although one cannot rationally request that others do not follow the first two rules of reciprocity and try to remove one from their property or take back what you have stolen.

An exception to this is if the theft or squatting ahs gone on long enough that the thief or squatter has in fact invested more of their labor time in the object or land or whatever than the original owner did, in which case taking that property back would actually do more harm to the new owner than they did to the old, violating the proportionality of negative reciprocity.

I must note here that one is not simply justified in using any means necessary to protect one's property, but instead must use methods to protect it that are proportional to what the violator did. For example, if someone enters my house, I cannot begin by shooting them. I must ask them to leave, try to guide them out by the arm, and only when they start resisting my attempts by attacking me, may I engage with them in self-defense while also trying to move them out of my house. However, preventing someone from entering my house in the first place is not an attack on their autonomy, as they had no right to be there in the first place, nor is preventing someone from entering some space, as I have just as much right to stand in a certain spot (even if it happens to be at the entrance of some place they desire to go) as they do, and if they attack me to move me out of the way, that is *their* fault.

Furthermore, all the direct and known-beforehand consequences of actions taken in the name of negative reciprocity count as part of their consequences, and therefore must be counted when it comes to whether they are proportional or not.  Thus, kicking someone off of my property and hence directly off the edge of a cliff, forever, does not merely count (as naieve right libertarians imagine) as kicking them off my property, but also counts as killing them when they reach the bottom of that cliff.

## 5. Mutual Aid Under Individual Autonomy

The ultimate expression of the third rule of reciprocity is the gift economy and mutual aid, two principles of social organization not commonly associated with left-market anarchism, but perfectly compatible with it and actually endorsed by the principles outlined here.

In the gift economy, one grants needed items to others, with the hope and expectation that one one likewise needs something that other people have, they will grant it to you. Note that the concept of a gift economy relies on the concept of property being associated and rightfully aligned to a person, but simply being granted to others by its owners without a direct and upfront, proportional charge. Hence a gift economy is only possible within the context of a society that supports property as an extension of autonomy and reciprocally respects it.

Mutual aid[^14] is when participants, who view each other as equals, instead of charity-giver and charity-receiver, organize together in an attempt to help each other (and themselves by extension) and solve problems, by attempting to pool what they can give and take as little as possible (only what they need). Essentially, a voluntary organization along the lines of Marx's classic saying "from each according to [their] ability, to each according to [their] need," at a small enough scale that free rider problems can be avoided through social reprecussions, and within the context of individual autonomy instead of absolute individual subordination to the community or the collective. These can work (and historically have worked very well[^11]) to provide insurance, health care and health insurance[^12], and law enforcement[^13], and banking[^16].

## 6. A Vision of Society Under the Ethics of Reciprocity

Given all of this reasoning, what should a rational actor, one who understands the value of autonomy (and the danger of authority and coercion) and the power of reciprocity (and the danger of unilateral interactions), envison as an ideal society, where most people also interact according to this ethic? What should we hope and push for?

First of all, a society centered around reciprocity would be a society that is fundamentally hostile to authority, especially coercive authority, but also any kind of rigid and universal authority of one person over another. It would be a society that focuses on mutual trade on a market, and prefers trade that is equally beneficial to both parties, and aid by free, equal, autonomous individuals. This is a peer-to-peer, horizontal view of society, where every individual has their sphere of absolute autonomy, outside of which — when they overlap with others — they must make voluntary contracts with others.

Second, it would be a society with respect for property, both as a sphere for the individual to have sole autonomy over that is separable from other individuals, the community, or the collective, and as an expression of past labor time and therefore past autonomy that can still be abridged through theft (which is essentially retroactive slavery). However, it would be a society with far less respect for absentee property, especially as it results in domination, authority, rent, profit, and usury (all of which are unequal, non-mutal trades and forms of authority and dependance on both ends), even though there is labor time (and therefore past autonomy) invested in it, because it destroys a greater amount of autonomy directly for those expected to respect it in the hope of reciprocal gains than protecting it would foster.

Third, it would be a society that is organized around the ownership of land and the means of production by those who use it primarily, so worker cooperatives or peer-to-peer micromanufacturing networks and fluid meshes of individual or small groups of contractors that connect when necessary to produce what is needed. It would be a society where all law is agreed horizontally between people (backed up by mutual insurance and protection associations), in the form of contracts, conflict resolution, and mediators, instead of top-down legislators and judges, or the force of the whole community against a minority constructing one conclusion.

Fourth, it would be a society that simultaneously understand the concept of collective property (*not private property*) as well as indivdiual property: property that is the product of the cooperation of multiple people, either on purpose or as emergent behavior, will be the property of the community that came together to produce it.[^13]

[^13]: https://www.panarchy.org/rodericklong/property.html

This would be a society focused around a freed market, which, even with absolutist property rights, tends to eliminate the autonomy-destroying aspects of capitalism as well as communism. Freed markets and capitalism are not identical — in fact, they are antithetical. It is primarily the state privileges granted to the wealthy and the big corporations, in the form of regulations, intellectual property, cartelization, licences, artifical scarcity, legal preference in initial establishment and legal recognition, land grants on unimproved land that preempts proper homesteading, emminent domain, crackdowns and neutering of labor movements, subsidization of long range transportation, and more.
