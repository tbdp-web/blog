## 1. Introduction


Reciprocity is the heart and soul of a society that tends to benefit all of its members. When every positive action is rewarded with positive action, then more positive actions are taken, in the expectation that that positivity will be returned; when every negative action is rewarded with negative action, fewer negative actions will be taken; hence, due to the forces of social development, the interaction of everyone who is part of the network of reciprocal interactions  will tend to produce a mesh of individuals acting for mutual, and greater overall, benefit. This is a mesh that is self-preserving and self-stable, as any violation of it is greeted either with negative reciprocity or a withdrawal (however temporary) of positive reciprocity, which motivates each individual to continue it, preserving the overall interest of everyone. Each individual tries to give and receive equal benefits (be those material, or in the form of consideration and respect for others), and no one will try to gain too much more from each interaction than another, knowing that it will break the beneficial stability of mutual reciprocity which protects them from likewise being taken advantage of, or retaliated against, by others. This is possible without destroying the benefit of positive interactions because positive gain is not a zero-sum game: when we trade, we can both benefit at the same time, by getting something more useful to us than we had before, and those benefits can tend toward being equal; when we interact and I respect your autonomy and consider your interests, that does not mean that I lose my autonomy or interests, since you can also consider mine.

Equality of rights and mutual benefit of all is not enough to make a society worth living in, however. Each member of a society must also be in possession of their autonomy as an individual, to chart their own course, pursue well-being, virtue, and flourishing according to their own reason, and not subordinated to any other person. Even if there is a single, objectively correct standard for virtue in human beings, which is the extent and total of all that is relevant in determining whether someone is flourishing or virtuous — and this is not the case, as there are (diverse) individual virtues — that would not mean that the removal of the autonomy of the individual, separate from other individuals or the collective, would enable it. Subordination, for the individual's "own good" or not, kills the individual's ability to choose their own character (which eliminates any virtue in living any specific way, as it does not develop the mind or the character, and the actions lose their reward) exercise their own reason (which is crucial to one's life and existence as a human being instead of a pack animal for the use and maintenence of others), and pursue their own flourishing (because being at the mercy of others means one is at the mercy of those whose interests necessarily do not always aline with yours, and who do not have all the information oneself does concerning one's own flourishing). It smothers in its sleep the possibility of virtuous character and flourishing in the individual. And indeed there *are* individual virtues: things necessary to the flourishing and fulfilled life of a particular individual that are different from all other individuals, yet objective and not malleable *for that individual*. Only they are in a position to know what these things are, yet they are crucial for the individual's happiness, so they must be free to act as individuals to achieve them.

Combine reciprocity and knowledge of the value of autonomy, and this network of interactions will preserve the freedom and autonomy of its members, as each member respects the autonomy of the others in order to encourage others to respect their own, and no one tries to abridge the autonomy of themself or others, even in the name of protecting autonomy overall, because such disrespect breaks the reciprocality of interactions and will lead to the breakdown of respect for autonomy. If every interaction must be mutually beneficial and it is only harm — violation of positive reciprocity of the respect for individual autonomy — that is met with proportional harm — negative reciprocity — then there will be an overwhelming tendency in the network of interactions that forms society towards equality, egalitarianism, and the elimination of hiearchy and authority.

In light of these things, which I will defend and elaborate in more detail, I think it is clear that an ethic of egoist interest in one's own flourishing will tend towards being an ethic of general reciprocity. Hence, this ethic is binding, not in the absolute "from-outside" sence of traditional moral realism, but in the sense of shrewd advice to those who care about their own well-being, which I believe is all human beings. In light of this, this is an ethic that is not to be imposed on people from the outside — that violates its own tenets, its very point for existing — but encouraged in people. That is why I champion it: because I want to live in a situation where most people adhere to it, and I think it would be benificial to all involved if that were the case.


## 2. Reciprocity


### 2.1. Why Reciprocity

Autonomy in one's own life and affairs, as I have argued in the introduction, is the key ingredient in being able to live one's life in the best way possible, and when generally respected will lead to a non-hierarchical, non-authoritarian society, which is desirable for those who have freed their minds from the shackles of the idea of 'legitimate authority' and the need for social organization and control from above, as it will allow each and every person to pursue whatever path best interests them, and to interact with each other only when it serves both those paths. Therefore, if an ethic of reciprocity will encourage others to respect my autonomy, then it is generally in my best interest to follow it, even if I give up a little by having to respect the autonomy of others. Likewise, a society that overall follows an ethic of reciprocity and respects autonomy for everyone, without exception, is more stable in its respect for me as an individual than a society that is fickle and choosy, even if that works in my favor sometimes. A society that respects the autonomy of only a few, or compromises on autonomy, for some or all, will find it easy to shrink the list of those who "deserve" autonomy or the range of everyone's autonomy, after all. Therefore, it is in my best interest to generally promote an ethic of reciprocity in everyone, to each other, instead of just in interactions with me and in myself, in order to produce the society described in the previous section. If one is to seek one's own autonomy, promoting a society that maximizes autonomy for all, and the reciprocity of all interactions including reciprocal respect for autonomy, both by one's words and by one's matching deeds, is wise.

Autonomy is not the only thing we can and should use positive and negative reciprocity to promote, however. We should use it to ensure that all actions are mutually beneficial to both parties (and as equally beneficial as possible), whether that is through mutual trade or mutual aid, and that each interaction is on a level playing field of moral consideration. This will increase even further the positivity of all interactions, although it is also a more stringent requirement.

Why use reciprocity, and not unilateral force? To attempt to establish, by force and from above, an order that respects your autonomy, is to institute a hierarchy in society that will necessarily be detrimental to your own autonomy in the long run, as your autonomy will ultimately end up subordinated to whatever institution  constructed to operate above you and the rest of society. Worse, a race to capture that apparatus will begin, and others will be disinscentivized to care about your autonomy, as you did not care about theirs. Therefore, reciprocity is the best strategy to achieve autonomy, because it works on a mutual, horizontal basis, instead of introducing any hierarchy and authority into society, and it directly incentivizes others to respect your autonomy by respecting theirs, instead of by threat of force (at least, purely).

Why commit to this strategy of reciprocity generally? Because being known to consistently commit to a strategy is a good way to get other agents to act in light of it.[^1] If one acts on it only inconsistently, or with too many exceptions, then it broadcasts that one follows the strategy less effectively, and for strategies that rely on others responding to your strategy, this decreases the effectiveness overall. Thus reciprocity directly gains one cooperation from the individuals one interacts with, but it also builds up one a reputation for acting a certain way, that future individuals, who you may only interact with once, may use to choose whether to cooperate with you or not.

### 2.2. Positive and Negative Reciprocity

If one respects the autonomy of others, and interacts with them in a positive way, one is much more likely to be able to convince those others to respect one's own autonomy, and to interact with oneself in mutually beneficial and positive ways. There are two reasons for this.

First, because if you make it clear that you are treating other people positively in expectation of a return of that positive treatment, then they are incentivized to return it, in order to continue your positive treatment of them. If you do not return the positive cooperation I offer you, then reciprocity is broken, and I will cease to cooperate with you as well, ceasing to respect your autonomy and to give benefits to you when you do not respect mine and do likewise for me. Thus I motivate you to respond to my cooperation with like cooperation by the hopes on your part that I will cooperate with you, and you likewise motivate me to cooperate with you in the hopes that you will continue to cooperate with me. This is what is called a Nash equilibrium: because we both follow the same strategy, it is optimal for both of us to continue this strategy in most cases; otherwise, we loose benefits.

Second, because human beings actually are *more* motivated by reciprocity than would be suggested by the purely rational calculus outlined above: we are motivated to cooperate with people who have cooperated with us even if it is a one time interaction[^0], and to go out of our way to cooperate with those who have cooperated with us, or punish those who did not, even when it is irrational to do so in a direct cost-benefit analysis[^1][^2]. We are motivated to do this by feelings such as anger and resentment, but also friendship, trust, gratitude, and more. It would be foolish not to be aware of this aspect of human existence and actions in others. It would also be foolish to ignore these feelings in ourselves and try to stick to a rational decision theory only, as those feelings are their own negative or positive rewards, that, when not taken into account, take their own toll.

Consider, also, that engaging in this form of positive reciprocity with others will actually encourage them to cooperate with you *even if they don't like you*[^8] or don't know you well. This means that it is possible to build a society around positive reciprocity in respect for each other's interests and autonomy without requiring that societies devolve back to small communities where everyone knows and likes each other, and has specific positive relationships with one's neighbors.

Reciprocity is not always just about cooperation and goodwill, however. As mentioned when speaking about punishment and resentment above, in more extreme interactions, where someone not only ceases to cooperate positively, but actually does something negative, actors can respond with **negative reciprocity**. If you actively violate my autonomy, and interact with me in a way that is unfair and deleterious to me, it is in my interest to repay that with like and proportional disregard and harm, so as to motivate you to cease doing that, and it is likewise in your interest to commit to the same strategy, to motivate me to avoid harming you.

Importantly, in the case of negative reciprocity, one can only prove one's commitment to this strategy of repaying harm with harm and unfairness with unfairness by action if someone else has already committed a harm or unfairness towards you, otherwise you would be the one ceasing cooperation first, so it is important to *verbally* post one's commitment to this strategy in order to make it known as a deterrant, whereas with positive reciprocity one can simply demonstrate with actions. Therefore, it is often beneficial to have explicit agreements or contracts with others concerning what will cause each of you to engage in negative reciprocity and to what degree, and to form mutual associations to multiply the force of such a commitment. Thus a "law" of sorts, built in game theoretic committment strategies and contracts, forms in the egalitarian world of mutual reciprocal interaction.

Proportionality is also crucially important when engaging in negative reciprocity: after all, if one engages in a grossly disproportionate act of retribution, others in the social mesh of mutual reciprocity that is the "community," including and especially the ones you reacted against, are far more likely to view this as a *new* violation of mutual respect for other's autonomy, instead of a proper response. Meanwhile, if you stick to something in like kind and proportional, it will be clearer what it is a response to, and that it is not an overpayment. This is how one avoids blood feuds and the destruction of the social mesh that comes with such things. Importantly, the proportionality of the violation will have to be established mutually, through mediation with the one you are in conflict with, and socially if others are likely to act on behalf of the one you are retaliating against, or view you as a threat and cease positive reciprocation with you in return for perceived violations of proportionality (which it is in their interest to do, in order to incentivize everyone in the community to stay playing the reciprocal game even better).

This ethic of reciprocity might begin to sound like the primitive ethics of "an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth," but there are crucial differences. Primarily, not hurting others (by being unfair to them, exploiting them, or by disrespecting their autonomy as individuals) is a form of positive cooperation with them, and therefore there is a positive clause to balance the negative one: "a gift for a gift and an eye for an eye." Furthermore, this strategy, while primitive, is so lasting for a reason: it is actually, as I believe I have demonstrated, and has been extensively demonstrated in various scientific disciplines, one of the best strategies for actors that have to engage in repeated interactions with each other and/or can gain reputations.[^3][^4][^5][^6][^7]

According to social anthropologists, reciprocity is actually a powerful basis for the success of our species and the formation of civilization. Quoting from [Wikipeida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(social_psychology)#An_adaptive_mechanism) (because I don't have access to the sources it is referencing, and because it's quite clearly written):

> Richard Leakey and [Roger Lewin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Lewin) attribute the very nature of humans to reciprocity. They claim humans  survived because our ancestors learned to share goods and services "in  an honored network of obligation".[[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(social_psychology)#cite_note-11) ... [Cultural anthropologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_anthropology) support this idea in what they call the "web of indebtedness" where  reciprocity is viewed as an adaptive mechanism to enhance survival.[[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(social_psychology)#cite_note-12) Within this approach, **reciprocity creates an interdependent environment where labor is divided so that humans may be more efficient**. For  example, if one member of the group cares for the children while another member hunts for food for the group, each member has provided a service and received one in return. Each member can devote more time and  attention to his or her allotted task and the whole group benefits. This meant that individuals could give away resources without actually  giving them away. **Through the rule of reciprocity, sophisticated systems of aid and trade were possible bringing immense benefits to the  societies that utilized them.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(social_psychology)#cite_note-:1-1) Given the benefits of reciprocity at the societal level, it is not  surprising that the norm has persisted and dictates our present  cognition and behavior.**

### 2.3. The Principles of Reciprocity

There is a fundamental difference between two kinds of positive reciprocity, and so far I have treated these two variations of reciprocity as equivilant for the sake of simplifying the foregoing conceptual analysis. I think it is time, however, to split them out, as I begin to formalize what the principles an individual following this ethic of reciprocity would follow.

These two forms of positive reciprocity are *active* positive reciprocity and *passive* positive reciprocity. Passive positive reciprocity is cooperation with others to the extent of *avoiding* taking certain actions towards them. This is best exemplified in positive reciprocity with respect to autonomy: to positively cooperate with someone in respecting their autonomy, all I need do is refrain from interfering with them. Conversely, active positive reciprocity is more stringent: I need to actually take a particular action that is different from the action I would have taken otherwise, in order to give a positive gain to the other person that they would not have received had I not taken that action. It is the act of giving a gift, as compared to the act of simply leaving someone alone.

Passive positive reciprocity, because it usually requires so little from the person giving it, while increasing the liklihood of receiving something so important (safety from harm and theft, and one's autonomy to act and pursue one's own interests without being subordinated to or hindered unjustly by another) is a principle which holds effect in a far greater range of circumstances for a self interested actor than active positive reciprocity. After all, this ethic is only a set of heuristics and principles for a self-interested person to act by, not an absolute deontological set of rules handed down from on high, so if great enough needs arise, it can (and should) be cast to the wayside.

This is why there is a greater expectation and focus, in my ethical and social writing, on passive positive reciprocity, in the respect for the autonomy and boundaries of others, than there is for active positive reciprocity, which is by far a more variable principle and depends almost exclusively on individual circumstance.

In light of this, the first and most important principle of the ethic of reciprocity is this:

#### (1) **DO NOT HARM OTHERS IF THEY HAVE NOT HARMED YOU.**

This is the principle of passive positive reciprocity: cooperate with others, by *not* invading their boundaries and by respecting their autonomy, as long as they continue to do likewise and in the interests of encouraging them to do so. If they cease to cooperate with you, cease to cooperate with them: you are free to take positive action against them and their boundaries, to a proportionate degree. I will cover this in the next principle. If they begin cooperating again, return to cooperation with them, as that will ensure that they have an incentive to continue to cooperate with you, since if you will cease cooperating with them permamnently, they have no incentive to start cooperating again either, because you won't respect them either way, and that way lies feud and gain for no one.

Always, then, the first principle is to maintain and continue and encourage *positive* passive reciprocal relations, whether that means opening with cooperation with new people, building up commitments and a reputation for such cooperation, or forgiving people (perhaps after some reparations to you) for ceasing to positively cooperate for awhile and returning to positively cooperating with them once that is done. The point is that when everyone engages in positively reciprocal, mutual relationships, everyone gains, and being willing to return to positive reciprocal relationships, after some punishment (either in negative reciprocation or just the cessasion of positive reciprocation for a time), ensures that those who mess up or do bad things have an incentive to stop doing so. 

#### (2) **IF SOMEONE HARMS YOU, HARM THEM BACK IN A PROPORTIONATE MANNER**

This is principle of negative reciprocity: if someone ceases cooperation with you, especially if they take action to disrespect your boundaries or your autonomy (negative action), you *must* respond in like kind, in order to discourage them from doing so again, and therefore maintain positive reciprocal relations across the board. This means responding to negative actions towards you with negative actions (active negative reciprocity) and responding to a disregard of your autonomy, boundaries, or interests with like disregard (passive negative reciprocity).

Be mindful, however, that the purpose is not simply to punish them for the sake of punishment, but to demonstrate a commitment to not being pushed around; furthermore, the purpose is not only or primarily to satisfy one's own desires for revenge, but to do things rationally. Listening only to one's desire for revenge is how you violate proporitionality in the eyes of the person you are in conflict with and the eyes of the community, breaking reciprocity yourself and making it worse for everyone. Thus it is better to act in a way that involves a punishment voluntarily agreed upon by the person who violated your autonomy and satisfactory, if relevant, to the rest of those with whom you wish to maintain positive relations, in the interests of placating everyone and returning to positive reciprocity while also disincentivizing violating it in the first place. 

Furthermore, it is in your interests to focus on making the ability to positively reciprocate whole again, which means ensuring that the person who hurt you is not themselves unilaterally or unsympathetically punished, and not resentful and unlikely to resume positive relations with you simply because you punished them. This means that negative reciprocation must be more voluntary than not on the part of all parties, even the one who initially broke reciprocity. This does not mean it must always be so, however, because in extreme enough cases the benefit of stopping or discouraging negative action far outweighs the dangers of permanently ending a chance for positively cooperative relations or proportionality.

#### (3) **ACT TOWARDS OTHERS AS YOU WOULD HAVE THEM ACT TOWARDS YOU, AS LONG AS THEY CONTINUE TO DO LIKEWISE**

This is the principle of active positive reciprocity. This is actually in one's own interest in fewer situations, and to a less significant degree. It should not dominate the wide middle swatch of payoffs the way the previous two rules should. However, when taken as the basis for mutual, peer-to-peer interaction and voluntary, fluid organization, it can be a very beneficial strategy indeed.

The ultimate expression of this third principle of reciprocity is the gift economy and mutual aid, two principles of social organization not commonly associated with left-market anarchism, but perfectly compatible with it and actually endorsed by the principles outlined here.

In the gift economy, one grants needed items to others, with the hope and expectation that one one likewise needs something that other people have, they will grant it to you. Note that the concept of a gift economy relies on the concept of property being associated and rightfully aligned to a person, but simply being granted to others by its owners without a direct and upfront, proportional charge. Hence a gift economy is only possible within the context of a society that supports property as an extension of autonomy and reciprocally respects it.

Mutual aid[^14] is when participants, who view each other as equals, instead of charity-giver and charity-receiver, organize together in an attempt to help each other (and themselves by extension) and solve problems, by attempting to pool what they can give and take as little as possible (only what they need). Essentially, a voluntary organization along the lines of Marx's classic saying "from each according to [their] ability, to each according to [their] need," at a small enough scale that free rider problems can be avoided through social reprecussions, and within the context of individual autonomy instead of absolute individual subordination to the community or the collective. These can work to provide insurance, health care and health insurance[^12], and law enforcement[^13], and banking[^16].

## 3. Autonomy

I have spoken at length about the virtues of autonomy and how one can use reciprocity to preseve autonomy and a society that is conducive to it. It is important, however, to clarify what I mean by autonomy specifically, as this will clarify what a network of people operating by this ethic will look like, and some of the things I have said about reciprocity previously.

I define autonomy as one's freedom to act in the sphere which effects only oneself and those who want to interact with you: freedom of association, freedom to direct one's own life, freedom to engage in trades and contracts with one's fellows, freedom to control one's own body and the motions thereof (labor time). Any freedom to act in a way that encroches on other's autonomy is not itself autonomy, but a violation of other's autonomy. Thus one's freedom to act increases when you can violate other's autonomy only by decreasing their freedom, and it does not constitute in an increase of one's own autonomy.

Additionally, autonomy has an element of independance: one does not unilaterally depend on the charity of others to survive, making one an inert and uncreative being, either at the mercy of others or subjecting them to your mercy, but produces value of one's own contributions of value to give them benefits in return for the benefits they give you, so that one is not a source of net loss of value for others, but of net gain for everyone, as both sides gain in interacting with you. This rules out, as an important mode of life that one might want to ensure through reciprocity, any sort of long-term parasitism as a lifestyle, while preserving the possibility that one might need to lose one's independance for awhile even if one pursues it as one should if one desires to prosper in life.

## 4. Property and Autonomy

Property can be seen as an extension of autonomy in two ways: both as a way to have resources at one's own disposal, for labor, self-sustinence, and other exercises of autonomy, that are seperable from the community or the rule of others and that you have sole choice of direction over, and as an extension of the past labor time invested in certain objects, the theft of which therefore undermines the autonomy of the labor that was done to modify that object, since now instead of being done for the rational purposes of the individual who did the labor, and therefore being autonomous, it turns out to have been done for the purposes of the thief, and thereby is no longer autonomous labor but servitude.

Given this conception of property that is similar in many respects to the Lockean or Nozickean conception of property, it is important to clarify a key difference between the account of property in a reciprocal ethic, and the account of property in a side-constraints or natural rights ethic. In a side-constraints or natural rights ethic, property must be respected, because it is an extension of individual autonomy, at all costs, and only in terms of its extension in labor, not the consequential extension the posession of property brings to people in having a free sphere for action. This is not the case in my ethic. If the posession of certain property is doing greater damage to the autonomy of an individual or group of individuals than violating positive passive reciprocity in this case would bring by making others less likely to respect those individual's own property, then it is in fact in their interest to cease respecting that person's autonomy as expressed in the labor time invested in that posession.

Property can only really be used to abridge the autonomy of others in two ways. First, when it is being used to directly damage that person or their own property, such as in the case of using a weapon against someone's person, or in bulldozing their house. This is a clear negative action which individuals should respond to with negative reciprocity and which suspends positive reciprocity. Second, one can provide property for the use of others, but on conditions that allow you to dominate and control the actions and lives of those others. This is the case of absentee ownership. Here, the property is being used to abridge someone's autonomy, but it is not as clearly a direct violation of their cleary boundaries of self, only of their ability to make their own choices about thier own lives. Thus, under a naive view, it would be harder to justify negative reciprocity in response to this. As noted above, however, if ceasing to respect the autonomy of the absentee property owner would bring more direct autonomy, in having direct control over the property the owner used to lord it over, on the part of the individuals previously subordinated to the absentee property owner, than the individuals might lose due to the decrease in the general liklihood of others to respect thier own property and the decrease of the holders of that property's likelihood to do likewise, than it is fully justified.

I should note, as well, that it would be easier to overcome the general benefits of positive reciprocation of respect for property with the detriments of respecting absentee property ownership than it would to do so with respect to property that is currently being used and occupied by others, because use and occupation are expressions of another, more important kind of autonomy that can be expressed in property, beyond invested past labor time, and so it would be more detrimental to the individual to lose the positive cooperation of others in respecting their own used and occupied property. It is more devistating to lose the house you live in, than to lose one of two houses you live in occasionally, and more devistating still to lose the house you live in than one you rent out to others.

Furthermore, to reiterate a point made some time ago, direct self-interest can overcome reciprocity, meaning that theft and squatting can be engaged in rationally even in the absence of the foregoing considerations, although one cannot rationally request that others do not follow the first two rules of reciprocity and try to remove one from their property or take back what you have stolen.

An exception to this is if the theft or squatting ahs gone on long enough that the thief or squatter has in fact invested more of their labor time in the object or land or whatever than the original owner did, in which case taking that property back would actually do more harm to the new owner than they did to the old, violating the proportionality of negative reciprocity.

I must note here that one is not simply justified in using any means necessary to protect one's property, but instead must use methods to protect it that are proportional to what the violator did. For example, if someone enters my house, I cannot begin by shooting them. I must ask them to leave, try to guide them out by the arm, and only when they start resisting my attempts by attacking me, may I engage with them in self-defense while also trying to move them out of my house. However, preventing someone from entering my house in the first place is not an attack on their autonomy, as they had no right to be there in the first place, nor is preventing someone from entering some space, as I have just as much right to stand in a certain spot (even if it happens to be at the entrance of some place they desire to go) as they do, and if they attack me to move me out of the way, that is *their* fault.

Furthermore, all the direct and known-beforehand consequences of actions taken in the name of negative reciprocity count as part of their consequences, and therefore must be counted when it comes to whether they are proportional or not.  Thus, kicking someone off of my property and hence directly off the edge of a cliff, forever, does not merely count (as naieve right libertarians imagine) as kicking them off my property, but also counts as killing them when they reach the bottom of that cliff. This does not include consequences of actions taken in defense of my autonomy that are merely the continuation of something that would have happened otherwise, where the violation of my autonomy which I am undoing is merely a suspension of what would have happened had that violation of my autonomy not occured at all. For instance, if someone is dying, and they hook themselves up to me in order to use my body to survive, when I unhook them, I am defending my autonomy, but as a direct result of my action they are now dying again. This, however, is not my fault, since they were already dying before they interacted with me or I with them, and my action was merely removing an unjustly acquired suspension of an already-occuring process from their grasp.

## 6. A Vision of Society Under the Ethics of Reciprocity

A society, under my definition, in light of this egoistic, individualistic ethics of reciprocity, is simply the network of mutually acting and interacting individuals. A society is therefore identical to a "group," but on a larger scale. In light of this definition, what would a society composed of people mostly following this ethic of reciprocity, and valuing individual autonomy, look like? I cannot give specific answers to many questions about how things would be done, but I can offer a general picture, and examples of how things *could* be done, in order to elucidate the general consequences of following and endorsing this ethic.

First of all, a society centered around reciprocity would be a society that is fundamentally hostile to authority, especially coercive authority, but also any kind of rigid and universal authority of one person over another. It would be a society that focuses on mutual trade on a market, and prefers trade that is equally beneficial to both parties, and aid by free, equal, autonomous individuals. This is a peer-to-peer, horizontal view of society, where every individual has their sphere of absolute autonomy, outside of which — when they overlap with others — they must make voluntary contracts with others.

Second, individuals in this society would generally have a respect for property, both as a sphere for the individual to have sole autonomy over that is separable from other individuals, the community, or the collective, and as an expression of past labor time and therefore past autonomy that can still be abridged through theft (which is essentially retroactive slavery). However, it would be a society with far less respect for absentee property, especially as it results in domination, authority, rent, profit, and usury (all of which are unequal, non-mutal trades and forms of authority and dependance on both ends), even though there is labor time (and therefore past autonomy) invested in it, because it destroys a greater amount of autonomy directly for those expected to respect it in the hope of reciprocal gains than protecting it would foster.

Third, it would be a society that is organized around the ownership of land and the means of production by those who use it primarily, so worker cooperatives or peer-to-peer micromanufacturing networks and fluid meshes of individual or small groups of contractors that connect when necessary to produce what is needed. It would be a society where all law is agreed horizontally between people (backed up by mutual insurance and protection associations), in the form of contracts, conflict resolution, and mediators, instead of top-down legislators and judges, or the force of the whole community against a minority constructing one conclusion.

Fourth, it would be a society that simultaneously understand the concept of collective property (*not private property*) as well as indivdiual property: property that is the product of the cooperation of multiple people, either on purpose or as emergent behavior, will be the property of the community that came together to produce it.[^13]

This would be a society focused around a freed market, which, even with absolutist property rights, tends to eliminate the autonomy-destroying aspects of capitalism as well as communism. Freed markets and capitalism are not identical — in fact, they are antithetical. It is primarily the state privileges granted to the wealthy and the big corporations, in the form of regulations, intellectual property, cartelization, licences, artifical scarcity, legal preference in initial establishment and legal recognition, land grants on unimproved land that preempts proper homesteading, emminent domain, crackdowns and neutering of labor movements, subsidization of long range transportation, and more.
