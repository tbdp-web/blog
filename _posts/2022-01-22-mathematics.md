## 1. Introduction

In my [previous blog post](https://blog.alexisdumas.org/2022/01/03/fuzzy-logic.html) I introduced what I call fuzzy pragmatist Bayesian epistemology. To summarize, pragmatism is an approach to epistemology that focuses on arriving at beliefs that are *useful* (for navigating the world), instead of beliefs that are absolutely or ultimately or immutably true. My epistemology is a formalization of what I believe is the best method for arriving at such useful beliefs, given the limitations that we as humans have, using Bayes' theorem: essentially, we should adjust our levels of credence in different theories according to the inherent complexity of the theory, and the evidence we have for or against it.

This is a fundamentally empiricist and evidentialist approach to epistemology, and as such, it might be natural to ask where seemingly *a priori* disciplines such as mathematics and logic fit into this rubric. It seems pretty clear, after all, that we do not do experiments to discover mathematical theorems, or discover axioms of propositional logic among the trees on a nature hike; so if mathematics and logic are not based on evidence, how can they possibly be accounted for by an ineluctably evidentialist theory of epistemology? That is the question I wish to answer in this blog post.

## 2. Logic

Throughout this essay and the previous one, I have been *reasoning* — i.e. using logic. For essays that purport to explore epistemology, assuming logic, the very foundations of human knowledge, is a very big assumption to make. Yet, somehow, it is an assumption that is nearly *always* made. Philosophers almost always proceed by reasoning, or at the very least making statements that are coherent and appear to be about something, which requires assuming the basic laws of logic even if they are used inconsistently, when they go about epistemology. Even if, later, they explain why and how logic and reasoning works (a necessary component of any epistemology, in my opinion), it is by necessity an explanation, and not a justification, because any justification would necessarily be circular (using rationality to justify itself) and therefore taking it as correct or meaningful would undercut the very norms of reasoning one is trying to justify!

### 2.1 What is Logic?

The fact that logic is unjustifiable, yet also inescapable, is key to understanding what logic is. Logic is inescapable because it is fundamentally the the production of statements or descriptions that are meaningful to human beings, and the elaboration of the implications of such statements. Logic proceeds therefore according to certain rules that describe the limitations and requirements of the human mind to grasp anything. Logic is the process by which we can make a thought or communication mean something, and understand and elaborate on that meaning.

Symmetrical with the two functions of logic, there are two central principles that describe the operation of those functions, derived from the necessary requirements of the human mind with respect to meaning and its elaboration. In this, I take a similar view to the later Schopenhauer: all of logic can, in essence, be reduced to two principles, the first of which encapsulates and implies Aristotle's three laws of logic as corrolaries, and the second of which describes how to use the meanings generated by the first, how to understand their implications. Any thoughts or statements which violate the first principle will inevitably, upon close inspection, reduce to pure gibberish, even if it is not obvious at first. Likewise, any thoughts or statements that are supposed to be related, but which are not related by the principle of logical derivation, will, upon close inspection, be revealed to be non-sequitors, the truth of one statement not implying or containing the other, and the truth of the other having no obvious relation to the truth of the former.

This is not to say that logic is merely the codification of "common sense" thinking. This is clearly not the case, as people casually engage in all kinds of fallacies and cognitive biases all the time. Logic is instead the codification of the basic principles that must be assumed by the human mind *even to violate them*, which implies that they are the necessary and sufficient conditions for meaning, since some meaning must be present in order for a violation of meaning or sense to occur. All else, all the other processes that the human mind does, are superfluous to the study of what is at base necessary for meaning, and the study of what the consistent application of those criteria entails. That such consistent application is a good thing is implied by the fact that anything that does not engage in it falls apart on close, critical inspection, or does not provide compelling information to those who do not already agree, and in the fact that those principles are what the mind operates on in the first place. If the core, inescapable assumptions of the mind are such, that is an indication that there is something important about them!

The human mind is a system capable of error correction, like a networking system. It will use incorrect, incomplete, but close-enough heuristics when it can get away with it, while operating at the higher level to provide a substrate for the rest, to patch up the connections. So one must consciously choose to engage its higher-level, more advanced, more critical functions, and must continually choose to do so in order to maintain it at its highest level of ability to produce meaningful and correct statements consistently. Logic is a description of how this higher level, more likely to be correct, more critical system of meaning production, elaboration, and analysis would tend to act, "as the limit approaches infinity." The listing of proper deductive forms and their opposites, fallacies, is a project of conscious human effort and analysis over millenia, documenting the processes of the human mind that tend to work and to produce meaningful statements and elaborations that hold up to consistent scruteny, and those that can happen to be correct but are not so often.

In order to make it clearer what I am talking about, and because it is interesting, I will now elaborate on the two principles of logic.

#### **1. The Principle of Meaning**

A sign is a word, a symbol, or other differentiatable sense object which *means* something. It is granted this meaning by the establishment of a relation between a *signifier* (a sense experience, e.g. a sound or image) and a *signified*, a concept (category or particular object). This is done by saying that X ***means*** Y, or X ***is*** (a) Y, thereby assigning the properties of Y to X: whatever properties are present in Y, they then become present for the concept which X represents. This assigning of the properties that must be to some degree present for X essentially narrows down the range of concepts which the signifier X can represent, so that its scope becomes that of one concept, its new signified.

You may notice that the definition of concepts above is not expressed in terms of predicates which are true or false of a given concept, but instead in terms of properties which are or are not present. This is because the latter is a shorthand way of describing a much more complicated system of understanding what a concept *is*, what it means, what constitutes its definition, which I propose must replace essentialism. Essentialism is the idea that some core list of binary predicates defines the necessary and sufficient conditions for whether any object belongs to a concept/category or not. This idea runs into serious challenges in the real world, or even in the world of philosophy, quite quickly, as it often becomes apparent that a group of phenomena which it would be extremely useful and sensible to categorize together have no common list of necessary and sufficient predicates which could be used to define those objects, and *only* those objects, as a set together. Every time this is attempted, some thing that would be usefully categorized as part of the set is left out, because it does not share a "necessary" predicate, or some thing which is not usefully categorized as part of that set is included, because it has a "sufficient" predicate. Take, for a trivial but clarifying example, the definitions of soup or sandwich. Is a hot dog a sandwich? Is cereal a soup? Hence, instead of concepts/categories/signifieds being defined in terms of a list of necessary and sufficient binary predicates, I instead choose to define them in terms of a list of ranges (or, rarely, specific values) for properties or features which each represent an axis on a high-dimensional [latent space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_space). In essence, a "concept" is a cloud or amorphous "area" of the space of all possible properties where things are relevantly (and relatively) similar to each other. Something like this:

![latent space visualization](https://blog.alexisdumas.org/assets/math4.png)

Particular things (other concepts, or particular phenomena of experience) can have those properties to a greater or lesser degree, or have fewer or more of those properties, meaning that particulars are essentially a single "point" in that latent space in which concepts exist, a point that can be closer to the center of the amorphous category, or more to the edges, or closer or farther from the edges — i.e. a particular thing can be more or less part of a category, or not part of a category but like it to a greater or lesser degree; whether X "is" Y is thus really a continuous value, a measure of the geometric distance between the edge of the category-cloud and where this a particular X falls, where if the distance is positive, the greater it is the less X is a Y, and if the distance is negative (if X falls inside the cloud), the smaller the negative value (the further X is from the edge, but *inside* it) the more X is a Y. In essence, "X is a Y" is a point on a spectrum from "very not like Y" to "very like Y."

Important to all this, a signifier, whether it refers to a particular or a concept (both of them are valid signifieds), must be assigned a certain list of properties, and certain values or ranges for those properties. It cannot be simultaneously assigned multiple, incompatible values, because then its meaning would be indistinct and incoherent. It would not be clear what the signifier signified, and therefore what to do with it or how it relates to anything else.

As an example of this  process of assigning meanings to signs through assigning them a list of properties and their ranges to assign a concept to them, take,  for instance, what happens if I say that "chair" ***means*** "a four legged piece of furniture designed for seating one person." If I do this, then the signifier "chair" will henceforth be interchangeable with the that longer description, which specifies and implies several different properties which have particular values for the ultimate chair, and which particular things may be closer to or farther from. For instance, something could have three legs, or five, legs, but if it is still furniture designed for seating one person, it is pretty close to a chair; something could have four legs and not be designed for seating people but nevertheless be *used* for that, in which case it is *functionally* a chair; something could have four legs and not be designed or used for sitting, like a table, in which case it is not very like a chair, but is still sort of similar; and so on. Thus when I say "X is a chair," what I mean thereby is that X falls close enough to the point or grouping in latent space that "chair" represents that it is useful to categorize it as such for practical purposes.

Importantly, sometimes essentialism *does* work. Sometimes there are a grouping of necessary and sufficient binary characteristics which make up a category. This is the case quite often in formal studies of mathematics or mathematical logic, for instance, and can sometimes happen for everyday concepts too, if they happen to have particular values for their properties instead of ranges, and a small(ish) list of properties that are all relatively essential. That is actually the case with the example above. But in more general, larger, less toy cases, those kinds of categories tend to be nowhere to be found — for instance, in the definition of human, or consciousness, or morality, or gender.

All this might naturally raise the question of how the signs used to define other signs are themselves defined. In reality, the meaning of every sign is enmeshed in a dense and highly interconnected web with the meaning of every other sign; this web zig-zags and loops and backs up on itself, an intricate knot of reference and relation; but ultimately, the meanings of words are first established by pointing them out, by physically establishing the relationship between a signifier and some real phenomena in the world by direct and repeated experience. This is how we teach babies language, this is what we do when explaining the basic meaning of a word to someone who does not share our language. Everything else after that is built up by a process of intuition and guesswork.

How are concepts arrived at, though? How do we know how to categorize the phenomena — both of the external world and of our own inner mental life — with which we have to deal? After all, in the process of assigning meanings to concepts, of determining what concepts to have and care about, how to interconnect all the concepts in our mental web of understanding, there are decisions to be made. Despite what the Platonists might have you think, there is not one way to conceptually categorize things. I contend that the process of categorization, the assigning of properties to concepts, is done primarily on the basis of practicality. Some ways of categorizing the phenomena of our experience are more useful than others, and if the general purpose of epistemology, at rock bottom, is to help us navigate the world, to serve as a practical tool, then the core motivation for categorization must be the practical need to navigate the world. Therefore, while categorization is arbitrary in the sense that it *can* be done any which way, not all categorizations are created equal, and fundamentally the motivating force behind most established categorizations is practicality. Nevertheless, because the construction of categorizations is a volitional human process, other motivations can sneak in. Thus, concepts can be introduced primarily for the purpose of aiding in communication, or motivating others to do things, or to gain power over others. These categories must be disguised so that they are difficult to distinguish from the actually useful, relevant, or important categories which make up the core of our ability to think and speak, so that they do not seem clearly manipulative or dispensable, but they will never *truly* be anything more than a manipulation.

So much for the principle of meaning as applied to signs and the concepts or particulars they represent. The same principles apply, *mutatis mutandis*, to propositions themselves, since propositions provide a (partial) description of a particular or a concept, using signs to talk about the properties and degrees that are relevant. Essentially, the propositions one gives must add up to a description of a valid concept or particular, which satisfies the conditions for meaning in a concept, particular, and the sign that refers to them. For instance, if I say "the sky is blue," I am saying that a particular range of locations applies to the property "color" of the particular indicated by the sign "sky." I am merely further specifying the concept that the sign sky is referring to. If, however, I *also* say "the sky is green," then I introduce a problem: I have attributed two separate ranges to the same property. Because of this, my meaning is inherently unclear — do I mean it is a blue-green mix, or do I mean it is one range or the other? There is no decision procedure to select which my meaning must be, and so the implications and uses of the complex of propositions I have presented are muddled.

#### **2. The Principle of Derivation**

This principle describes the methods by which the implications of a meaningful proposition or sign can be explored, expanding them into an interconnected web of coherent statements. The core method by which one proposition can imply another is as a result of the fact that, if proposition A is accurate (if the properties assigned to the signs involved correspond to the properties of the particulars meant by those signs), then for proposition B to be not accurate also would imply a contradiction. And contradictions are meaningless, so to assert that A is true but not B would result in two incompatible sets of descriptions of the world, neither with precedence, and so neither actionable (on a mental or physical level). This is **material implication.** There are other forms of implication that can be built out of using the basic concepts of conjunctions, material implication, and non-contradiction, but I won't delve into them here.

### 2.2 Justification and Meta-Justification

To return to my original point about logic, logic cannot be justified, but as I have explained, and you have just seen, it is nevertheless inescapable for any thinking (let alone acting and communicating) human being. This means that while it is impossible to justify it according to the principles usually used for justification (which use logic), there is a sort of **meta**-justification for the use of logic, and strict adherence to it, to be had. If it is inescapable, better to document that it is a presupposition implied by all thought and argument, document how it works, and apply it consistently.

Formal systems of logic (including classical Aristotelian logic) are ways of encapsulating the principles of meaning and derivation I described above and working through their implications; they, like math (as I will discuss below) are human constructions, and can be modified as we discover new things about how meaning works, and what types of implications are likely to consistently lead to positive results, as opposed to what are not (this is why we have to build up a list of fallacies, and some moves in logic were recognized as valid for a long time before being discovered not to work). These formal systems of logic are justified only inasmuch as they approximate well how meaning actually works, and therefore inherent the meta-justification of logic (in the abstract, meaning) itself.

## 3. Mathematics

Mathematics is, essentially, a game we play, like Chess or Go, but instead of playing mathematics with physical pieces that move around a board, we "play mathematics" with symbols marching down a page. We invented the game of mathematics by assigning relationships between various symbols, creating symbols that transform other symbols according to a set of rules, and ways of abbreviating combinations of symbols. Every time we do mathematics, we are simply exploring what happens when we set up the pieces of the game a certain way and play it out according to the rules we've established. Because we aren't aware of the implications of the rules beforehand, it can often feel like one is "discovering" some fact through the process of "doing math," which is why mathematics often feels like exploring some Platonic realm of numbers and sets. Nevertheless, that's not what's happening here at base. The core of what mathematics is, far from being discovered, is constructed — it is only discovered in the sense that a new board game is "discovered": creativity is applied to the rules of the game, to find the ones that are the most fruitful and practical. We just don't tinker around with the fundamental axioms of mathematics often enough, now that it's been established for at least a few hundred years, to realize that's what we're doing at the core. Like so many other social institutions and cultural ideas, those who have received the tradition no longer remember how it came about, or what it really is, but instead have come to view it, because of its sacrosanct status and pervasive influence, to be a sort of supernatural thing hovering in the aether somewhere above and to the left of human reality.

The fact that mathematics is ultimately constructed is made clear by the fact that people *invent* new mathematics ([Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry), [logarithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm), [Analytic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry), and [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus)) based on their observations of the behavior of things within the bounds of their experience, in order to have a more rigorous and consistent language for describing those things, a language the axioms of which can actually be *wrong* when compared to reality. This means that mathematics isn't magically connected to the real world somehow, but is only connected to it, and successful in describing it, because it is a product of our own experiences and our attempts to codify them. Indeed, new bases for *existing* mathematical axioms (such as [ZFC set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory)) have been constructed specifically to deal with fundamental contradictions and holes in previous mathematical systems, and new branches of mathematics (such as [propositional calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus), [lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus), [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory), [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory), or [Bachmann–Landau notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation#Family_of_Bachmann%E2%80%93Landau_notations)) are constantly being invented, not by pulling some new construct out of the inherent implications of old ones, nor by looking into some abstract world, but by thinking about how it would be useful to describe things and how such descriptions could be consistently made clear and formalized.

This is why it is fundamentally confused when people marvel at the "the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences." In some cases, we are essentially creating a template based on things we see in the real world, then looking around for other instances of a similar pattern and adjusting the template to fit the parts of the new pattern we have, to see what the new pattern would look like completed if it really is like the old pattern. And most of the time we're right, because the inherent properties of the first part of the pattern *require* it, for logical consistency to hold, to look like the rest of all similar patterns, but sometimes we're wrong too! In other cases, we are simply using mathematics, as a very flexible and concise language with a lot of tools for expressing different relations, to describe what we see, just like we could use English to do the same thing. Being surprised that this latter thing works is like being surprised that someone can look at a scene, describe it in words, and then those words actually match up to the scene. If you understand how languages work, it is hardly more surprising than anything else that we experience on a day to day basis — languages are *designed to do that!*

I think what confounds this otherwise obvious realization is that when one is doing mathematics, there are often times when some leap of intuition must be used, and even in those basic cases of constructing new axioms for mathematics, oftentimes the particularities of those axioms are also driven by intuition. How can this be, the Platonist asks, if mathematics is just a language/game we've made up to use as a tool? Again, I think the answer lies in thinking of mathematics as fundamentally a product of intellectual entrepreneurship in much the same way programming languages or board games are. Human beings necessarily have an intuitive understanding, which is both evolutionarily "programmed" and learned over the course of our abnormally long (for an animal) childhoods, of the laws and interactions of the world around us. Since the goal of mathematics (whether one is playing by the rules or making them) is to help us construct a language to describe and predict actual phenomena, we can apply our intuitions about how things work to constructing mathematical rules. Additionally, human beings very often can develop intuitions about the subjects of our work or passion, so in the case of mathematicians, intuitions about what constructs are likely to lead to fruitful or wieldy results, for instance, are more than possible. Additionally, to some degree, mathematics is a codification of how we think or what makes sense to us — laws of thought — given certain other axioms of mathematics (I will cover this in more depth later).

## 4. Conclusion

In conclusion, logic is the prerequisite for meaning in thought, and formal logics are an attempt to encapsulate the rules of that. Mathematics is a linguistic system for describing a subclass of the phenomena that humans interact with in a precise and clear way, where the rules are constructed by humans based on what is likely to be useful, and applied like a template to reality.
