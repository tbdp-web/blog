## 1

Up till now all of my work on epistemology has framed the discussion in terms of reducing epistemic risk being a normative requirement: unnecessarily complex theories increase your risk of being wrong, so they should be avoided; things should not be believed in until the risk that they are true is established by evidence and that evidence outweighs the risk that they are false contained within their inherent improbability. This is the epistemic framing I deployed in my previous essay, the ['Summa Atheologica'](https://blog.alexisdumas.org/2022/02/08/atheism.html), as well, to describe why I saw no reason to believe in any gods or religions, and why doing so was in fact a bad epistemic choice. Lately, however, I've been questioning more and more epistemic normativity I've been assuming. As a moral subjectivist, I view the only conceivable normative force someone could have to be their own personal desires and motivations. Outside of that, there is nothing that can even coherently be said to impose a duty, or an obligation, or an absolute requirement, on anyone. Of course, human beings generally share certain basic core desires and motivations, and a the same general situation — being embodied social creatures — so this allows some surmise, but the fundamental structure of normativity appears  to me to be subjective, therefore barring any absolute statements of "should" or "should not" independent of a particular individual and their situation. So far, however, I have not completely extended this fundamental insight to the rest of my philosophy. Primarily, the one area where this insight has not completely been integrated is in my epistemology: although I have long since embraced pragmatism and phenomenology as the core bases of my epistemology, meaning that the normative force of rationality stems from the practical considerations of our motivations and desires in interfacing with the world *as we experience it*, instead of stemming from some absolute standard of transcendental truth which it is our duty to achieve, even if it is beyond the world that we actually experience and live in, I have still been assuming that only one kind of pragmatism counts — that is, the pragmatism of reducing the risk of being wrong. I have been treating the requirement that epistemology be "pragmatic" for achieving an individual's goals as a reason to treat doxastic risk-reduction as an absolute goal.

The problem with this is that it ignores that there are many other axes along which beliefs can help us achieve our goals and desires, and how the relative risks and rewards and the various factors involved in an individual's life might drastically change the landscape of what beliefs are practical even *despite* some beliefs being objectively more epistemically risky than others. In other words, I have been doing in epistemology what I long since abandoned doing in ethics as untenable: trying to come up with an objective and context-independent account of what will satisfy all people's desires best, by taking a single aspect of desire-satisfaction and reifying it into a fixed idea. This is simply an inconsistency, and one that needs to be rectified, because I have been assuming in a sense the exact same normativity to rationality that I reject in other philosophers. Throughout history, philosophers have treated it as a normative duty to adhere to a transcendental truth, rationality, and set of intellectual virtues, in a way that is perfectly analogous to how they treated morality, specifically deontology. In fact, this is so clearly the case that theories of moral normativity have in some cases been *derived* from the duty to achieve pure rationality — as in the case of the Kantian categorical imperative, which he justified in terms of the absolute human duty to be rational even if it does not make them happy.[^1] I rejected this duty to be absolutely rational in attempting to divine transcendental truths, or in willing things, as thoroughly unjustified and in fact unjustified by definition, ostensibly leaving myself only hypothetical imperatives to work with, only to turn around and embrace the duty to be absolutely rational in one's pursuit of the maximum risk-reduction in one's epistemology! To make matters worse, I recognize in all other areas of life and action that absolute risk-reduction is unnecessary, yet I chose to ignore this in  my own epistemology.

Why is this? Well, primarily it was because I had in my head a false dichotomy: in my mind, the choices were either that we all had a duty to choose the beliefs that were most likely to be correct, or all beliefs were totally on even footing, one just as good or likely to be correct as another. Thus, although I accepted the rest of the tenets of perspectivism — that all of our knowledge is ultimately predicated on our particular perspective, that no one has access to the absolute truth unfiltered by the angle through which they view it, and that truth is best moved towards not by trying to objectively compare a theory to "reality", but through a dialectic and comparison of many perspectives — I have up till now balked at the final view: that the truth-value of a belief (assessed, for me at least, through risk and predictive power among other things) may not actually directly correspond to its *worth* to the person holding it. Yet, as Nietzsche says, “it is no more than a moral prejudice that **truth is worth more than mere appearance**; it is even the worst proved assumption there is in the world" — that is, nowhere have I seen it proven that truth is of absolute value, nor can it be, because such a claim is in the same boat as the rest of morality: chopped off by Hume's Guillotine.

This brings me to the subject of this essay: faith. If I acknowledge that there are other considerations that might weigh against the risk of accepting something despite it being very risky to do so, I must acknowledge that for some people, that risk might actually be worth it. To reiterate what I said before, everyone is different — the context of an individual's life matters deeply to making such an assessment, and furthermore that context is one that will never be fully available to anyone else *but* that individual. Therefore, it is fully possible that someone might be justified in choosing faith over reason, and although that does not require anyone else to make that same choice, or even make that choice justified or rational for anyone else, and although it doesn't make the belief itself rational, *fundamentally I cannot say anything on the matter.* In fact, I should not: people need space to choose for themselves what they will do and believe, and me trying to paternalistically tell them what is and is not good for them, regarding epistemology as with anything else, is a fundamentally patronizing and autonomy-reducing move on my part.

This is not to say that faith is a good thing at all times. Faith is a very brave and very scary thing to embrace, and can lead you down some very dark paths as well as some bright ones, because it is fundamentally a risk. It is choosing to believe something based on will alone, to accept the risk of being wrong by going against the lack of evidence, and even the evidence against. But for some people, that risk truly might be worth it.

Neither is this to say that I will never speak out against someone's choice to believe something on faith: if their choice to believe something is not simply a personal choice, that imposes risk on their own lives, in the form of however it changes their actions and how they live, if it is not simply a personal life choice, but becomes something that substantially influences the lives of others, especially if it becomes something that *harms* the lives of others, then I will speak out against it. Because for as much as it is anyone's prerogative to choose the risks they will endure, it is no one's prerogative to make others bear those risks as well if they don't willingly choose to share them. This is why I rail against many religions: they do not just peacefully live their lives. They spread their restrictive, hateful beliefs, hurt other people, and take over the state apparatus. If that were not the case, I would and should have nothing to say to them.

Except perhaps this: it might be worth it to attempt to live without faith, to see if faith does not bring the benefits you think it does, or that you don't need those benefits to be happy. Many people have never tried to live without faith in something, because they have been taught that to do so is to choose depression, emptiness, meaninglessness, or even amorality. I'm not just talking about particularly indoctrinated Christians here: even mainstream secular culture is soaked in professions that having faith in something is beautiful and necessary and an important part of human life. This is simply not necessarily the case —— for some it is, but for some it is not, and I think chances are that the majority of people don't *actually* need faith, they just have never been taught how to live and enjoy life without it.

Thus some people have attempted to live life without faith and found it unbearable when it need not be precisely because they were still operating on religious premises and expectations: they still expected meaning to be granted to them from outside themselves, in a sense, and to be constant and fixed, instead of an every shifting impulse of affinity from the core of their being. They still wanted to view themselves as created creatures, fitted with a singular nature and purpose, when instead they are creative nothings that change as soon as they come into being through the capacity for self-reflection, a wellspring of newness which can become through consistent choice and practice almost whatever they choose. They expect morality to be a set of transcendental laws inscribed in an immutable heaven somewhere, instead of an expression of their own values and meaning pushed out into the world. Leaving faith with these expectations is an exceedingly difficult thing to do; as Sartre says, the absence of god is actually extremely embarrassing for someone who wishes to remove her with few consequences to their worldview. If, on the other hand. you set these expectations aside, and embrace your own meaning and morality, the changeableness and immediacy of life absent the transcendent, absent faith, you may find that, if you give it a chance, it is invigorating, freeing even. Yes there is a certain amount of anguish to be found in the idea that all is permitted, and at the same time nothing is legitimated, that you are responsible to your fellow human beings and must answer to them for what you do, and cannot justify what you've done in terms of anything but your own desires and motivations. Yes there is a certain struggle with the absurd that takes place when one can no longer choose to rely on the special revelation of god for certainty in one's knowledge as Descartes did. Yes, there is a certain abyssal nature to being able to choose one's own meaning for yourself, every day and every hour, and letting it change and flow. But there is a grounding effect, a freedom to it, as well.

And if you choose to return to faith? So be it, and I wish you as much luck as possible! Moreover, having first found your way out of all your unjustified beliefs, all your faith, and returned to the bare necessities for living in the world of your experience, if you choose to return to faith you can build back from a clean slate: the forest fire that burns down half the forest leaves space for new things to blossom, and fertilizer from them. Just as with all endeavors of philosophy, the process is one of questioning your foundational beliefs and assumptions, venturing out into the no-man's-land of uncertainty, doubt, and untenable or incomplete beliefs, and then returning once more to stable, solid, pragmatic footing — perhaps to where you began from, just now with a deeper and wiser appreciation for what you believed, or perhaps to a new place entirely. One must progress, as Nietzsche's Zarathustra said, from the camel, which bears all duties and received beliefs with dutiful patience, to the lion, which rejects all such traditions and duties, to (if you so choose, I don't think this last step is necessary) the child, which willingly chooses and takes on its duties and beliefs.

Importantly, as well, when choosing which beliefs to have faith in, the criteria is no longer truth or risk, it is what makes you happy, what you find beautiful and inspiring to believe, what brings you comfort, and what does not harm others. Good things, things that make the risk seem worth it to you. In accepting that faith is what it is: a leap, a risk, a hope, you free yourself to choose beliefs that express who you are and make you happy. Thus, when building back your faith, you can choose to believe beautiful, kind, compassionate, interesting things — there is no need to return, for instance, to the horrid and judgmental dictates of Christianity or Islam. This is something I already see many people of faith doing: they are choosing to believe things that are expressions of their personality, and their inner beauty and compassion.

In conclusion: in renouncing the last aspect of unjustified normativity in my philosophy I have gained a new compassion and respect for those of faith who take it as a personal thing, who are willing to take a risk to believe in things for the sake of their beauty. This does not mean that I accept that the things people of faith believe are true; this does not mean that I don't think faith is a risk, or that some perspectives are more likely to be true than others or more worth something than others. This does not mean that I believe all faiths are equal. Nevertheless, I find myself in a more nuanced position than I was before, and I am very happy that that is the case.
