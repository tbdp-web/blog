Now that I've finally gotten around to writing out some of the more significant points of my epistemology,[^1] I can at last proceed to writing one of the articles that I've been planning to do pretty much since I started writing on this blog months ago: a fuzzy Bayesian analysis of argumentation. This was inspired in part by a discussion of how arguments work on the part of Dr. Graham Oppy (an atheist philosopher who I am deeply indebted to at least on metaphysical and meta-philosophical subjects), where he discusses how deductive, logical arguments in philosophy are actually far less effective than they are typically supposed to be, at least in more "classical" circles, such as philosophy of religion and theology. When I heard him talk about that, I immediately realized that what he was saying could easily be formalized by an application of Bayes' rule, and that this would serve to demonstrate the strength and coherence of his more theory-focused, holistic approach to philosophy, as a separate method from the traditional deductive approach.

Let's begin by laying out the classic form that an argument takes in philosophy. An argument typically takes the form of a set of premises, which are logical propositions, and a conclusion, which is also a logical proposition, derived by the rules of logic from the foregoing premises. Something like this:

| #    | Proposition          |
| ---- | -------------------- |
| 1    | All women are mortal |
| 2    | Alexis is a woman    |
| âˆ´    | Alexis is mortal     |

Here, there are two premises and one conclusion, and the conclusion follows from the premises according to certain logical rules of inference. In this case, "all women are mortal" can be translated to "for any X, if X is a woman, then X is mortal," because for this proposition to be true, if X is a woman, it would involve a contradiction to say that X is not mortal; therefore, the conclusion follows by [*modus ponens*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens).
