A kaleidoscopic whirlwind of pernicious lies, half-truths, misrepresentations, abuse, and bigotry swirl around me and other trans people, especially trans women. I'm privileged to live in California and on the PSU University Park campus primarily, where I'm insulated from the worst of American transphobia in my everyday physical life, but on the internet, where we are all connected regardless of location, and where anonymity protects those who wish to do us harm just as much as it helps us hide from it, it's not so easy. Nevertheless, through careful digital hygiene I have been able to insulate myself from the worst of the abuse - yet, every once in awhile, something slips through, usually due to my own actions. One such instance occurred yesterday, when I found myself engaging in a digital self-harming spree, scrolling through the abusive, ignorant, and hateful comments under a Medium article by trans feminist Julia Serano. Through the flurry of vitriol, one particular comment stood out to me as particularly hideous and insidious. It posed a simple question: "Why not fix them?"

Why not "fix" transgender people. If we believe we were born the wrong sex, and biological sex can never be fully changed, then we are forever doomed to be somewhat dissatisfied with our bodies no matter what changes we make. Instead of trying to change the body to match the mind, the commenter asked, why not change the mind to match the body? Why not give transgender people some kind of treatment to make us happy with the body we were born with, instead of trying, imperfectly, to make us more comfortable in our own bodies?

This is the central idea behind transgender conversion therapy. Setting aside that there is no evidence that such practices are effective, and the fact that what evidence there is indicates that they are [ineffective](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/conversion-therapy-an-evidence-assessment-and-qualitative-study) and probably [harmful](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2749479) or [based on misunderstood science](https://genderanalysis.net/2016/12/myth-pimozide-and-gender-dysphoria-gender-analysis/), and therefore that gender transition is the [best treatment we know of](https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-well-being-of-transgender-people/), the very concept behind it is disturbing. In this essay, I hope to show you why that is the case on an intuitive, empathetic level, through the use of traditional modes of ethical discussion - analogies and explanations.

The core thing you have to understand is that gender is more than sex. It's more than what sex you have, and it's more than what sex you want. That's a component of it - part of what makes many people transgender is dissatisfaction with their current sex characteristics and/or the desire to change them - but gender is also, and I think _primarily_, an aspect of identity. It is an expression of a fundamental desire to embody a complex, interconnected and overlapping group of different traits, from embodying certain social roles and relationships, to certain modes of expressing oneself, to any number of other things. Genders are fuzzy areas in that space, best identified in terms of Wittgenstein's ["family resemblances"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_resemblance)

If you ask most cis people, you'll find that most of them ([about 98%](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-014-0452-6)) actively identify with the gender they were assigned at birth; just think about it - most cis people are very happy to be men or women, enjoy being themselves _through_ alignment with their own gender, and wouldn't know how to live except as their own gender. This is more than the passive acceptance of a biological fact, throwing up one's hands and saying "Well, I guess I'm a man/woman." This is an identity.
