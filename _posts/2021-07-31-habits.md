A comment I made recently on Reddit that has a nice summary of how I think virtues and character works for egoists:

> I agree with this. Importantly, too, if you realize that in most cases virtuous actions have the better payoff matrix, you'll want to built up habits of acting virtuously, in order to make doing the right thing easier and less subject to temptation. But that means that you'll want to act virtuously even in the exception cases where you could get away with it (theft when you knew no one would commit retribution) because building up good habits for your whole life is probably more beneficial, more prudent, than getting this individual benefit, since making virtuous action subject to the assessments of practical rationality in the moment is to eliminate it's habitualness.

> I also think that there's a narrative component to having a virtuous character too. When you ask yourself questions like "what sort of person am I," it's about the habits you've built, the inclinations you have, and the actions you've taken throughout your life; and this is a question that I think matters to people way more than is generally noted: if you're the "sort of person" that you would like to be around, then it's easier to be self-assured, happy, complete, actualized, and if you're not, well, that's how you get shame.

> Also, personally I prefer calling the sort of long-term happiness you're talking about "fulfillment," as it has more of the connotations of how I conceive of it, but that's also because I think exercising and developing our capacities both as human beings and as mammals (with the former being dominant over the latter, of course) is key to our fulfillment too: this is why people who creatively make things, who are fit, and who have close connections with people who they respect and who they communicate their innermost thoughts to, are generally happier â€” more fulfilled.
