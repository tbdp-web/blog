> That which dominates all my studies, its principle and aim, its summit and base... is that I affirm, resolutely and irrevocably, in all and everywhere, _Progress_, and that I deny, no less resolutely, the _Absolute_... Progress, once more, is the affirmation of universal movement, consequently the negation every immutable form and formula, of every doctrine of eternity, permanence, [perfection], etc., applied to any being whatever; it is the negation of every permanent order, even that of the universe, and of every subject or object, empirical or transcendental, which does not change. --- Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, _The Philosophy of Progress, First Letter.I_

Justice is a product of conditions, not a prescription of conclusions --- this is the key insight that lies at the heart of much of my discussion of anarchism. In conditions lacking [hierarchy and power-over](https://blog.alexispurslane.xyz/2022/07/18/power-and-hierarchy.html) --- the [anarchic encounter](https://blog.alexispurslane.xyz/2022/07/10/anarchic-encounter.html) --- the interests of each individual and collectivity that is party to any decision must be weighed equally and treated with respect, factored into the final decision, instead of subordinated to any other. As a consequence, any decision which springs out of the fertile ground of anarchy, watered with the blood of those who fight the ceaseless battle of vigilance against the reconstitution of domination, will be a decision which protects the full flourishing of [individual autonomy](https://blog.alexispurslane.xyz/2022/06/23/autonomy.html) --- the goal of [my anarchism](https://blog.alexispurslane.xyz/2022/01/17/what-is-individualist-anarchism.html). These decisions need not --- _will_ not --- follow any plan or pattern which I can lay out ahead of time; they will be specific to the local conditions and unique needs of those involved, drawing on tacit knowledge and common practice as well as more abstract things like science. This is a very good thing, too, because there are inherent compromises and blind spots in any social plan or set of institutions, which can vary in importance depending on the situation, so that if we are to subordinate norms to needs, the norms must be fluid and specific. Chosen by those who will follow them.

This means that I cannot present a single set of social norms or institutions as "what anarchy must be," as many vulgar market anarchists and communist anarchists do. I can provide examples of one way things _can_ work, a toolkit of various historically-inspired anarchist means of organizing and handling things like conflict, resource distribution, and community defense, which can provide a lifeline for those worried about what life might look like after the capitalism and the state, and I can even try to predict to some degree how things might fall out, but I cannot provide a social plan and enforce it. That would be to introduce a hierarchy in Stirner's sense, a subjugation of the individual will and interest to an idea, an abstraction --- a phantom.

The implications of this approach to anarchy, prefigured by Stirner, Novatore, and Proudhon, are far-reaching, and in this series of essays, titled "Anarchism: Process, Not Destination," I will be examining four interesting and important results of thinking about anarchism in this way:

1. In [part one](/2022/07/27/process1.html) of this series, I will explain why insurrectionary anarchism is superior to revolutionary anarchism, and how this is related to totalizing social plans;
2. In [part two](/2022/07/27/process2.html) of this series, I will examine why social planning is both undesirable and contradictory to the goals of anarchism, and how responding to that leads one to social theory instead of social planning;
3. In [part three](/2022/07/27/process3.html) of this series, I will lay out my Neo-Proudhonian theory of how societies work;
4. And in [part four](/2022/07/27/process4.html) of this series, I will apply that social theory to explain why anarchism is better than other ways of organizing society.

This was originally a single essay, but I found it necessary to break it up so that I had the space to elaborate on each of these ideas in a way that is focused and manageable.
