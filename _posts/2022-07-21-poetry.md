Your servility is necessary\
So they tell me\
There is no alternative\
So they tell me\
\
A master for your home, a master outside your home\
One for every place you live\
We own the land under you and the sky above\
One for every moment alive\
\
Possessed --- "not me, but it in me" ---\
I see you walk around\
Phantoms speak through you, friend\
They weigh your eyes to the ground\
\
I want to ask you a question, but it comes out a scream\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Is this inescapable?**\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This invisible fist around our throats?\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is another world really --- unattainable?\
\
I'm not an oracle\
So don't ask me to plan it all out\
Conditions, not conclusions\
But I have a magic hex for you, a wilderness-born shout\
\
Your face turns pale, I see it\
A rain of ash; smoke in the sky; we'll take them to account\
It's okay to be afraid, we all are\
But is this pain any less fearful?

## Dedication

I personally haven't suffered a lot at the hands of the system, besides medical issues because I'm trans, but I've had to watch people I love suffer, their bodies and minds crushed by impersonal forces beyond their control, the vicious cycles of the capitalist world.

Nothing I'm able to do feels like remotely enough and so I've taken on their pain as if it was my own.

This is for you, Rose and Aaron.
