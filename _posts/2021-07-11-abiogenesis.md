title: Abiogenesis Back Of the Napkin Calculations
---
> Although the chosen values are spectacularly approximate, the linear nature of the equation ensures that variations in any factors by even a few orders of magnitude do little to alter the basic outcome. In the scenarios considered, the abiogenesis probability per unit time per set of building blocks is found to range from Pa∼10−36, Pa∼10−36 to Pa∼10−30Pa∼10−30, with a value of Pa<10−33Pa<10−33 being broadly compatible with the specific case of the Earth. Thus, in this case, Eq. 1 indicates that a very small assembly probability per unit time could in principle be compensated for by the large scale of a planetary “search engine” —readily producing at least one abiogenesis event within a geologically appropriate timespan.

My own back of the napkin calculations based on their results indicate that the probability of life arising naturally in the observable universe is **120%**. This is factoring in the number of Earthlike planets in the galaxy (40 billion), the number of galaxies in the observable universe (about 125 billion is the smallest modern estimate), and the number of years before the first proto-cells likely emerged on Earth (about 700 million years). However, some fossils have been found that indicate that the first life-like things originated far earlier, so if I switch to a far less generous amount of time (220 million years, based on that study), we get a **40%** probability.

Notice, however, that I'm saying that the time-scale for the time `t` in their formula is in days, which is unreasonably generous since it takes *instants* for a molecular chain to bond once the molecules have lined up, and the unlikliness of that line up happening is already factored into their equation. Thus, if I switch to something slightly more reasonable such as hours for my timescale, but keep the harsher time limit, we get a probability of **964%**.

This is, of course, the probability that life will emerge via abiogenesis in the *entire observable universe*, but (through some calculations unknown to me) the scientists in the paper seem certain that the probability of it happening on Earth alone is not negligable, so I'm clearly missing something.

In any case, this seems to roughly indicate that at least until we know more, it is reasonable even as a Bayesian who judges hypothesis primarily on the probability with which they predict what we currently see, to accept that abiogensis is an adequate explanation for the origin of life.

Even if it was less than that though, my Bayesian priors in supernatural events occuring are so low, and the existence of a classically theistic God predicts so many outcomes (and so predicts each individual thing with less certainty) and also predicts a universe we don't see so much more strongly than the one we do, that I think it's totally reasonable to accept abiogenesis over a supernatural/theistic account for the origin of life.
