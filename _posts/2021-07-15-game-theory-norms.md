title: The Game Theory of Egoist Societal Norms
---

## Intro Note

I discussed these ideas in a previous post, but ever since I made that post, they've been growing and clarifying themselves in my head in a process more akin to metastasization than processing, and I think today is finally the day that they've developed and clarified enough that it's worth producing a second post. So, welcome to "The Game Theory of Egoist Societal Norms" version 2.0!

## Introduction

The purpose of this essay is threefold: one, I wish to demonstrate that market anarchist social norms (which can be reified into laws, in whatever sense laws can be said to exist in an anarchist society) are a feasable Nash equilibrium for rationally self-interested actors (actors who act on the basis of Decision Theory); two, to show that they are one of the *only* feasible Nash equilibria for a society of rationally self-interested actors; and three, that the fact that they are such an equilibrium point is an indication that egoists should value a move toward that point.

This is, in essence, then, an exercise in a sort of modern natural law theory (in the sense that Thomas Hobbes used it): demonstrating that a certain set of norms are a uniquely stable point for a society, and that they are furthermore beneficial for almost everyone to support and generally enforce and follow, if not follow in *every* circumstance.

## The Nash Equilibrium of Society

### How Society Enforces Norms Game Theoretically

Every individual in society has an interest in preventing any other individual in that society from harming, not just themselves. If a man murders my neighbor, although this does not perhaps directly effect me, it indicates that this murder is a threat: if he has murdered my neighbor today, what prevents him from murdering me tomorrow? Furthermore, if I have good relations with my neighbor, then any harm to my neighbor means that my neighbor now cannot enter as beneficial reciprocal relations with me: if they are murdered this is obvious, but if my neighbor is maimed, this means that he cannot help me weed my garden in return for me helping him fix his roof. In addition, even if there is no chance that the man who murdered my neighbor will murder me later (perhaps this man is a racist, and will only try to kill black people, and while my neighbor is black, I am not), if *this* murderer gets away, that might put it in the heads of others who would like to murder people for their own gain (perhaps another racist who only kills white people) that, since the whole rest of society is not united behind preventing murders, they might just be able to get away with doing whatever murder they want to do. The logic of murder, as I'm sure you can clearly see, extends to any other active harm as well.

Every individual in society can have an interest in harming any other individual in that society as well, however. I can gain more, in some cases, by stealing my neighbor's tractor from him, than by paying him for it, after all. (Why am I using so many weird rural analogies? Don't know!) In this way, it seems, we have arrived at an impasse: a free rider problem, where everyone together has an interest in maintaining an order of norms, but where each individual also has an interest in defecting from that order, just as long as everyone else does not, as one person defecting cannot unseat the entire order of norms. It doesn't matter if only *I* steal, that won't undercut the entire system of property! It doesn't matter if only *I* rape, it won't lead to *everyone* raping! It is better, in essence, to be a criminal in a lawful society, than a lawful person in either a criminal or lawful society... or is it?

You see, free rider problems can only emerge when enforcement is not possible (or excluded from consideration), yet the entire situation we are dealing with here is one of enforcement! Thus, we arrive at a Nash equilibria, a combination of strategies on the part of all the different players involved in the game such that each player has no interest in switching strategies. In this case, I both have an interest in violating the norms for my own interests, and preventing anyone else from doing so. Yet, indeed, everyone else has this same exact set of interests. Thus, the fact that everyone else has an interest in preventing anyone from defecting from the social order of norms eliminates my own interest in defending myself, and my own interest (along with that of everyone else in society) in preventing defectors likewise eliminates the interest of any individual in defecting from these norms as well.

Therefore, the egoistic interest I have in helping in the maintenance of a social order of norms that prevents harm, when translated onto everyone else because of their similar interests, leads to everyone having an interest in not violating that order themselves as well (except in extreme cases, such as if I'll literally die for sure anyway unless I violate the social order of norms). And our interest in committing crimes cannot outweigh our desire to prevent others from committing crimes towards us either, such that we reject our interest in preventing the risk of others harming us in order that we might harm others, for a number of reasons, not least among them the fact that whatever benefit we might gain from harming others (such as stealing from them) is itself made less valuable and put at risk by destroying the order that prevents others from harming us (such as stealing what we've just stolen). A thief only benefits from their thievery because the society around them is not in the habit of stealing --- otherwise he wouldn't hold on to his prize very long.

There is also something to be said here for commitment strategies as well (which David Friedman also covers in his lovely article, ["A Positive Account of Property Rights"](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Property/Property.html)). As an individual, demonstrating that one is willing to defend oneself --- or what one considers one's rights --- to a degree disproportionate to the individual decision-theoretic calculation of the situation, actually decreases the overall amount of harm that one experiences, as it discourages all but the most risk-philic actors from even attempting to extort you or cross you. Doing likewise for and especially *with* one's community likewise decreases the chance that any one of that community will be harmed, as the rest of the community will descend, in a severe manner, on whoever hurt one of their number. This can be directed toward an outgroup, but works just as well to prevent any members of the group itself from stepping out of line.

There are other considerations here, too, of course, that exit outside of game theory: the desire to model the norms one wants everyone else to adopt, as that makes it more likely for them to reciprocate, a sense of fairness or justice that might endorse these norms, and so on. I'll leave those aside for now.

### Equilibrium Norms

One of the most important points about the way this Nash equilibrium works is that each individual, each of whom has a *prima facie* interest in violating the social norms of the society, also has an interest in preventing *each other individual* from violating those norms, and so will join in the enforcement against all others, or support alongside everyone else the construction of institutions which will prevent everyone else from violating those norms and which, since they are constructed by everyone else and therefore must be agreed to and contributed to by everyone else, must also prevent each individual themself from violating those norms. Thus each individual in society has an interest in breaking the norms, but they cannot band together, because they want an exception for themselves only. As soon as a situation is introduced into the system whereby enough people have no interest in enforcing the norms at all, or no interest in enforcing them toward a certain group (which may or may not include themselves), the whole nature of the game changes. Now, it is not a giant web Mexican standoff where each person stops every other person. Instead, the graph changes and two groups form, which may enforce norms toward each other but not toward the in-group, or which merely enforce different norms on everyone than the other group. Suddenly, the equilibrium is broken, because the individuals who want to break the social norms can now find enough people to be on their side that there is not an overpowering and very likely negative payoff (being arrested and punished or having to stay on the run) to violating those norms!

There are four criteria which a set of norms must satisfy in order to avoid breaking the equilibrium state in this way: they must be generally universalized, they must be focused on preventing positive harm, they must be intersubjectively justifiable and verifiable, and they must also be generally superior for all involved to the state of nature in which there are no norms being enforced whatsoever. I will cover the justification for each of these criteria in order, below.

#### 1. Generally Universalized

The first criteria that equilibrium norms must satisfy is that they must be insufficiently oppressive, or, put another way, generally universalized. The Nash equilibrium described above works by oppressing each individual individually, but in a way that is also beneficial to them because it also oppresses everyone else. As soon as individuals do not gain from the like oppression of everyone else, the equilibrium will start to break down and criminality will begin to appear. Thus, for instance, if we introduced a norm that prevented everyone from masturbating, for instance, leaving aside difficulty in enforcement, this oppresses each person individually, but not only do I have an incentive to violate this norm myself, I have no incentive to enforce it on anyone else because the violation of this norm on the part of everyone else doesn't effect me whatsoever.

Furthermore, as soon as one *group* is oppressed over another, that entire group gains nothing from the like oppression of anyone else in the group, as they are all oppressed and cannot gain anything from being oppressed (the slave gains nothing from his master having slaves). Thus the entire group has an incentive to simply ignore the social norm that oppresses them, and in fact has an incentive to commit disproportionately to defending social norms which do not oppress them, to prevent further oppression. Of course, if the oppressed group is a sufficiently small minority of the overall population, the majority of the population can enforce those rules by force against them, but this is sacrificing the stability of the equilibrium still, as while the oppressed group might have an interest, thanks to the enforcement of the majority group, in obeying the social norms, they have no interest in enforcing or upholding or contributing to them, and an interest furthermore in uprooting these norms even if it costs them more than they gain to do so, as once a group begins to be oppressed, it will get even more so. This means that it puts the whole society at risk of continual rebellions and terrorism.

Furthermore, if we're talking about rationally self-interested egoists instead of people who buy into arbitrary ideologies, the very minority status of the oppressed group undercuts any interest most of the society can have in maintaining the oppressive social norms! Think about it this way: if a gain is had by oppressing, say, twenty percent of a society, how will those gains be distributed? Either extremely thinly, such that the effort of upholding such oppression won't be worth whatever you gain, or it will be concentrated in a corresponding twenty percent of society or so. But if the reason the minority can be oppressed at all is because it is below twenty percent of the population, then there is, by definition, no chance that the amount of people who benefit from the oppression will grow beyond around twenty percent either, so the chance that any of the majority group will be able to benefit from upholding those social norms is small enough that most won't care to. This is similar to a point made by Marxists, but with a little more nuance, based on the fact that class mobility does exist, and that proper decision theory weighs chances of future reward, not just current status; if most of society doesn't benefit, or has a very low chance of benefitting, from a set of norms, they won't have any interest in upholding those norms. The reason poor people have an interest in upholding property rights, for instance, is for two reasons: first of all, upholding property rights only up to a certain cap, is not a very obvious bargaining Schelling point, but second of all, and more importantly for our discussion, because class mobility exists and so there is a non-negligable chance that the poor person won't remain poor, and so will benefit himself from upholding those property norms. In the case of oppression of a minority group, however, since the range (and therefore chance) of the gain is proportional to the size of the oppressed minority, and that size must be very small for a civil war or terrorism to not be a significant negative factor, the chance of benefitting must be very small too, so it will be unlikely to be worth upholding for most of society. For instance, why would a poor white farmer in the antibellum South bother to return a black slave to his plantation? Historically, he'd probably do it because it was legally required and because he thought it was morally right, but if we exclude the second as ideology, and raise the same question for the first (why would anyone enforce that law), you realize that he has no interest in doing so.

Basically, then, we have a few factors at work that ensure that generalized universalization is required for equilibrium norms: first, if it oppresses everyone and nobody gains, it won't last; second, if it oppresses a large enough group, the discord caused will be greater than whatever the gain could be; and third, if it oppresses a small enough group, it won't be worth it for most people to uphold the social norms anyway.
