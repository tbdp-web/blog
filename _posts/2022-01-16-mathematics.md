## 1. Introduction

In my [previous blog post](https://blog.alexisdumas.org/2022/01/03/fuzzy-logic.html) I introduced what I call fuzzy pragmatist Bayesian epistemology. To summarize, pragmatism is an approach to epistemology that focuses on arriving at beliefs that are *useful* (for navigating the world), instead of beliefs that are absolutely or ultimately or immutably true. My epistemology is a formalization of what I believe is the best method for arriving at such useful beliefs, given the limitations that we as humans have, using Bayes' theorem: essentially, we should adjust our levels of credence in different theories according to the inherent complexity of the theory, and the evidence we have for or against it.

This is a fundamentally empiricist and evidentialist approach to epistemology, and as such, it might be natural to ask where seemingly *a priori* disciplines such as mathematics and logic fit into this rubric. It seems pretty clear, after all, that we do not do experiments to discover mathematical theorems, or discover axioms of propositional logic among the trees on a nature hike; so if mathematics and logic are not based on evidence, how can they possibly be accounted for by an ineluctably evidentialist theory of epistemology? That is the question I wish to answer in this blog post.

## 2. Mathematics

Although to some degree logic is the more fundamental of the two things I want to cover here, I'll begin with mathematics, because in my opinion it is by far the more interesting subject. In the philosophy of mathematics there are a dizzying array of explanations and interpretations of why mathematics "works," or what that even means. Therefore, I am sure my theory will probably bear some family resemblance to
