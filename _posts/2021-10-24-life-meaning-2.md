## 1. Introduction

The purpose of this chapter of *Human Being and the World* is to lay out my *diagnosis* of the human condition in light of the facts laid out in the [previous chapter](https://tbdp-web.github.io/blog/2021/10/11/life-meaning.html). Because of its different goals, this chapter will be written in a markedly different style: while the previous chapter was written in a didactic, rigorous, and academic style, as is proper for a phenomenological analysis of the facts of the human experience of Being, this chapter will be written in a far more inexact, literary style, in an attempt to paint a vivid picture of the challenges of human Being to the reader.

The goal is to make these challenges seem real, immediately felt; to call up the matching fears, worries, and desires in the hearts of my readers, so they can be laid bare under the light of our awareness. Thus, when I offer my solutions in the final chapter, they will seem more clearly needed and motivated, and since the problems they are suggested to solve will be clear and present in our minds, whether my solutions are fit to the task I have set them will be easier to judge.

I write this introduction, then, as a warning not to expect the same things out of this chapter that you expected from the previous one, and will expect from the final one. Each chapter has a different purpose, and hence a distinct accompanying style. 

## 2. The Human Condition

###### Every day, we open our eyes on a world that owes us nothing. There is no Fate, no Meaning, no Good or Evil, no Reason inherent in its Being. Nor is there any inherent in our experience of it: it is to us a swirl of luminous colors and shapes, a dance of sensations and experiences. It is our minds that must wrestle meaning from it, impose a flimsy canvas of order over the deep primordial chaos of Being. Each day we paper over more of that abyss, each day we *impose* new fate, new meaning, new goods and evils, and new reasons and patterns, on the chaos. We build reality up, turning that which "is what it is", a universe of singular and unique particulars, into something that *is*. We are born without even understanding that objects continue to exist without us seeing them, let alone of the patterns of concurrence that we later label "cause and effect." We learn that there are patterns in the chaos, we remember them, name them, and without any guarantee that those patterns will continue, risk our continued trust in them — for, after all, what else do we have to act on, except the patterns of the past? We walk backwards into the future, blind to what is coming, only aware of what is in the past, but it is all we *can* do. What else? Stop walking?

This process of constructing the sensible world around us is as much involuntary as it is voluntary; we live in a world that is circumscribed by our purposes and desires, a world where objects are automatically carried up into the roaring rapids of our narrative lives and given meaning, significance, purpose. We cannot help but walk through the world aware of only what things are in relation to our own luminous being, lighted by the lamp of our own existence, imparting that fiery glow of Significance onto everything we touch. We interact with a world not of simple shapes and sensations, nor of matter and energy, but a world of meaning, relations, symbols: Significance that we make. We are the gods of a world of our own making, each of us as individuals. Perfectly free to construct everything as we will: there is nothing outside of us or above us, only the laws we choose to give ourselves, and the stories we choose to tell. We are poet-deities, speaking all of everything into existence.

Yet we are also *not* free gods of an unshaped primordial Being. We are also ruled by the dark chaos that surrounds us, wary, weary travelers, trespassers even, strangers, padding on silent feet through the great cavern-halls and recesses of the infinite blackness which surrounds us, holding aloft the torches of our minds to illuminate this small corner or that, slowly growing a map of the place in our minds only to be confounded when some pattern breaks, when some inexplicable Being, some "is what it is" confronts us. Yet this is as much to our glory, our worth, our value, and as worthy a project, as that other picture: there is something beautiful about the idea of humankind denying darkness and chaos with a resounding "no," venturing further into it, mapping it, guiding our fellows through it and into it, growing, spreading, learning, gaining more and more of a fragile foothold in spite of what we are and what *it* is. There is as much romance in the picture of a caravel forging its way through crashing seas and bruised skies, the few lanterns hanging in its windows the only lights, tiny specks shouting a defiance at all that surrounds them made all the more brave by their size, as there is in the picture of beautiful, luminous poet-gods walking speaking existence into being that they may one day live in Paradise.
