> "Only great pain, the long, slow pain that takes its time... compels us to descend to our ultimate depths... I doubt that such pain makes us "better"; but I know it makes us more profound... In the end, lest what is most important remain unsaid: from such abysses, from such severe sickness, one returns newborn, having shed one's skin... with merrier senses, with a second dangerous innocence in joy, more childlike and yet a hundred times subtler than one has ever been before."

## About The Channel

I am an amateur philosopher with [post-concussion syndrome](https://www.cognitivefxusa.com/blog/post-concussion-syndrome-and-post-concussion-symptoms-pcs). I can barely read or write for any extended period of time now, but the desire to exist philosophically compels me to do something. In the end, I have found a compromise with my disability in this channel: unscripted but usually premeditated audio "lectures" concerning ideas I have spent the last few years wrestling with. The topics I cover on this channel include:

- atheism
- epistemology (empiricism, pragmatism, skepticism)
- phenomenology
- ethics (virtue ethics)
- political philosophy

The primary purpose of this channel is to produce encapsulated discourses on my ideas which I can reference later when I hopefully recover, and which I can send to my friends who are also interested in philosophy to start discussions with them. The primary purpose of this channel is therefore *not* to spread my views, especially since while I try to defend my views as rigorously as possible in my videos, because of the limitations of unscripted videos and my inability to do real research, I cannot defend my views in as much depth as I would like.

## About My Philosophy

### Metaphysics

1. Consciousness is incoherent without the world. Subjects require subjectivity, and subjectivity requires an object. The object of that subjectivity cannot ultimately be the subject itself, because the subject needs to exist first for it to be there to be aware of. So to bootstrap consciousness there must be something outside of it which it is capable of interfacing with. That is "the world."
2. The world is what it is and does not owe us an explanation; whatever explanation we wring out of it is a victory for mind and sanity, a privilege not to be expected but to be celebrated.
3. Everything is what it is, else it could not be. We have no other way to know then by appearance, so let appearances stand for themselves ultimately. And how else does reality appear to us but in the form of material objects, epiphenomena stacked on epiphenomena? What need is there for anything else, that has been demonstrated?

### Epistemology

1. We are thrown into the world with no choice but to deal with it on its own terms. The only reason we care about it is because it effects us through our senses, and because we can effect it only by its own rules; we should therefore learn about its rules using our senses.
2. Why should we distrust our senses or thoughts without a reason to do so? To believe anything before there is reason asks us to believe everything for which there is no reason, even the contradictions. Hence we should not believe our senses are *unreliable* or reliable without reason. But our only vector of knowing propositions concerning the things our senses tell us about is through our senses, so the only reason we could have for doubting a particular sense experience is if we already trusted other sense experiences. So either we believe that sense experience is unreliable for no reason (and then we might as well believe they are reliable for the same) or we believe that some senses are reliable and some aren't, in which case, the decision becomes based on the majority of sense experience because the majority is what we care about the most, since senses correspond directly to some quantity of "care."
3. The only way we can act is if we have something on the basis of which to guess what the outcome of that action will be, and we have no better source of information about the world in the future than what it was like in the past. Although the future might be different than the past, until we have reason to think so and information about what the change is, the null hypothesis should be the assumption that it will stay the same or similar, since we have no other source of information anyway and we cannot just act on no information at all or remain paralyzed. Furthermore, this strategy of loose induction is inherently self-correcting, as if we are wrong and something has changed, we will find out and change our beliefs. Thus, we should base our understanding and reconciliation of appearances on choosing a theory that best predicts all past facts using as few assumptions as possible, and operate on the basis of this theory *prima facie*.

### Ethics
1. I ask you, why would we mourn a lack of meaning? Why would we want a universe that gives us objective purpose and meaning? Whatever purpose or meaning it could give would be just as cold, heartless, and uncaring as a universe without meaning anyway, because that is the nature of objectivity. At least this way, we can set our own course.
2. Life has no inherent meaning outside of its natural desire to continue and flourish. All life has this desire, because that which does not have this desire — or does not at least desire this desire, which reduces to the same — has or will shortly cease to exist, and certainly does not seek philosophy. Meaning can be constructed out of this by finding what we are best suited to become and finding things to test ourselves against to grow and goals to pursue. "We must imagine Sisyphus happy."
3. My ethics is objective in the same way a doctor's advice for a patient is objective: it applies to them whether they think it does or not, and applies in virtue of both objective facts about them, the external world and, most importantly, their inherent desires. It is not absolute, just as a doctor's advice can include conditions that change based on context, and neither is it universal, just as a doctor cannot give the same medical advice to everyone. Yet, most human beings share certain desires and values, and limitations on how to achieve them, so I can provide advice for most people.
4. As for those who do not share these desires and values innately (the psychopaths and extreme depressives and mentally ill), I cannot help you, but I do not think anyone can anyway, so I say this: as long as you do not hinder the pursuit of valued and desired flourishing on the part of us, the rest of humanity, we will not and need not bother you. But if you hinder us and hurt us, we have no reason not to defend ourselves from you and take our retribution too, because the only thing that can motivate us to do or not do anything is our desires and values, so if you violate those, and we must ask to rescue them, then there is no reason stopping us from doing so.

### Politics

1. We must begin absolutely free because there is nothing inherent about humans, human desire, or the metaphysical nature of reality that dictates authority or limitations. . Any limitation on this or institution or hierarchy or authority must justify itself to us in terms of our desires, our being, or the nature of reality. Thus, any hierarchy must be based on convenience as determined by the ones it seeks to control: i.e. consent.
2. We must begin absolutely free because to constrain the actions of others when their actions hurt no one else goes against (with few exceptions) the general deep values and desires that are inherent to humans, so it is not the best way to gain flourishing on the part of those who act, whether they think so or not.
3. We must begin absolutely free because if the default position was unfreedom, and a reason must be demonstrated for freedom instead of the other way around, then we would begin in a condition where nothing, not even the giving of that reason or action upon it, would be allowed, and that is clearly untenable.
4. Politics besides this is merely the reconciliation of two problems: what people can do while maintaining their flourishing and the flourishing of others, and what, within those bounds, optimizes overall flourishing. An order that requires, for instance, the rejection of individuality and choice, theft, murder, servility, parasitism, or anything else like that is one that requires of those who maintain it something that is unethical for them, whether or not it would maximize flourishing overall, and therefore cannot be permitted.
