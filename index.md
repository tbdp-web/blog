Welcome to my journal. This is where I write essays primarily on political and social philosophy, but also occasionally on things like religion and epistemology, from my own personal, idiosyncratic perspective. If you want to learn a bit about me, just look to the left, I have a little bio there. I hope you enjoy what I have to say!
