Hi there, and welcome to my blog! Right now, you might be feeling a little overwhelmed. There are a *lot* of posts here, with obscure titles that include phrases like "fuzzy bayesian" and "ontology," and a lot of them are pretty long, so that's totally understandable. That's why this blurb is here: to help you pick out which posts you should start with if you want to get a feel for the ideas I'm talking about and a taste for my style and approach to things.

First of all, you should know that I pretty much exclusively talk about five subjects: **existentialism**, **ethics**, **atheism**, **anarchism**, and **epistemology**. Those are my specialties, if you will. If you've found my blog, I assume you're interested in at least one of these categories.
