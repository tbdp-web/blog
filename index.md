title: Welcome to Luciferian Locutions!
---

Hi there, and welcome to my blog! Right now, you might be feeling a little overwhelmed. There are a *lot* of posts here, with obscure titles that include phrases like "fuzzy bayesian" and "ontology," and a lot of them are pretty long, so that's totally understandable. That's why this blurb is here: to help you pick out which posts you should start with if you want to get a feel for the ideas I'm talking about and a taste for my style and approach to things.

First of all, you should know that I pretty much exclusively talk about five subjects: **existentialism**, **ethics**, **atheism**, **anarchism**, and **epistemology**. Those are my specialties, if you will. If you've found my blog, I assume you're intrested in at least one of these categories.

To get you started, then, here are some of my best articles (as of the time of this writing) on each of those subjects:

1. **Existentialism**: \
   For a really comprehensive introduction to my approach to existentialism, you can't go wrong with my ['Human Being and the World' series](https://blog.alexisdumas.org/2021/10/11/life-meaning.html), which currently has two parts.

2. **Ethics**: \
   On ethics, I recommend you start out with ['An Introduction to Anarchist Egoism'](https://blog.alexisdumas.org/2021/12/08/egoism.html). Although it's not as fleshed out of a defense of moral subjectivist egoism as I'd eventually like to write, it serves the purpose in the title perfectly. As a follow-up, if you want to get a look at the kind of desires I, personally, as an egoist, have for society and interactions with my fellow humans, check out ['Anarchistic Relations'](https://blog.alexisdumas.org/2021/12/19/relations.html).

3. **Atheism**: \
   I haven't written very much on atheism yet, but I have actually done individual debunkings of most apologetics, in a lot of depth, addressing the best and most up-to-date versions of each of the arguments, on my YouTube channel, and I plan to turn those into articles very soon.

4. **Anarchism**: \
   I definately recommend you start with ['What Is Individualist Anarchism'](https://blog.alexisdumas.org/2022/01/17/what-is-individualist-anarchism.html), since that's intended to be the clearest and most concise statement of my political views that I could make. 'Anarchistic Relations' (linked above) is also a very good article to read on this, as well as ['Property Provisos'](https://blog.alexisdumas.org/2021/12/24/difference-principle.html) and ['Why I Am No Longer an Anarcho-Capitalist'](https://blog.alexisdumas.org/2021/12/09/not-ancap.html). If you *really* want to dive into the deep-end, you can also check out my twenty-eight thousand word treatise on anarchism, ['Two Principles of Anarchism'](https://blog.alexisdumas.org/2021/10/27/reciprocity.html), although my views have evolved since then to a certain degree.

5. **Epistemology**: \
   If you want a little taste and introduction, you can start with ['Two Kinds of Pragmatism'](http://127.0.0.1:4000/2021/07/24/pragmatism.html). Once you feel ready to dive into the deep end, I recommend following that up with ['An Introduction to Fuzzy Pragmatist Bayesian Epistemology'](https://blog.alexisdumas.org/2022/01/03/fuzzy-logic.html) and ['Dyadic Epistemology: A Primer'](#under-construction).
