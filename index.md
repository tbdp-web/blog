# The Brain Damaged Philosopher

> "Only great pain, the long, slow pain that takes its time... compels us to descend to our ultimate depths... I doubt that such pain makes us "better"; but I know it makes us more profound... In the end, lest what is most important remain unsaid: from such abysses, from such severe sickness, one returns newborn, having shed one's skin... with merrier senses, with a second dangerous innocence in joy, more childlike and yet a hundred times subtler than one has ever been before."

> â€” Friedrich Nietzsche, *The Gay Science*

I am an amateur philosopher with [post-concussion syndrome](https://www.cognitivefxusa.com/blog/post-concussion-syndrome-and-post-concussion-symptoms-pcs). I can barely read or write for any extended period of time now, but the desire to exist philosophically compels me to do something. In the end, I have found a compromise with my disability in this channel: unscripted but usually premeditated audio "lectures" concerning ideas I have spent the last few years wrestling with. The topics I cover on this channel include:

- atheism
- epistemology (empiricism, pragmatism, skepticism)
- phenomenology
- ethics (virtue ethics)
- political philosophy

The primary purpose of this channel is to produce encapsulated discourses on my ideas which I can reference later when I hopefully recover, and which I can send to my friends who are also interested in philosophy to start discussions with them. The primary purpose of this channel is therefore *not* to spread my views, especially since while I try to defend my views as rigorously as possible in my videos, because of the limitations of unscripted videos and my inability to do real research, I cannot defend my views in as much depth as I would like.
