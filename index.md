> "Only great pain, the long, slow pain that takes its time... compels us to descend to our ultimate depths... I doubt that such pain makes us "better"; but I know it makes us more profound... In the end, lest what is most important remain unsaid: from such abysses, from such severe sickness, one returns newborn, having shed one's skin... with merrier senses, with a second dangerous innocence in joy, more childlike and yet a hundred times subtler than one has ever been before."

## About The Channel

I am an amateur philosopher with [post-concussion syndrome](https://www.cognitivefxusa.com/blog/post-concussion-syndrome-and-post-concussion-symptoms-pcs). I can barely read or write for any extended period of time now, but the desire to exist philosophically compels me to do something. In the end, I have found a compromise with my disability in this channel: unscripted but usually premeditated audio "lectures" concerning ideas I have spent the last few years wrestling with. The topics I cover on this channel include:

- atheism
- epistemology (empiricism, pragmatism, skepticism)
- phenomenology
- ethics (virtue ethics)
- political philosophy

The primary purpose of this channel is to produce encapsulated discourses on my ideas which I can reference later when I hopefully recover, and which I can send to my friends who are also interested in philosophy to start discussions with them. The primary purpose of this channel is therefore *not* to spread my views, especially since while I try to defend my views as rigorously as possible in my videos, because of the limitations of unscripted videos and my inability to do real research, I cannot defend my views in as much depth as I would like.

## About My Philosophy

### Epistemology

1. We are thrown into the world with no choice but to deal with it on its own terms. We cannot control it by wish or will nor make it go away. Nor can we cease to care about how it effects us. So why not try to figure out how to act with it, in it, make it do what we want by its own rules? Whatever "it" is that we see, let us learn it through our senses, since our senses are the only reason we care about it and the only way it effects us anyway.
2. Moreover, why should we distrust our senses or thoughts without a reason to do so? To believe anything before there is reason asks us to believe everything for which there is no reason, even the contradictions. And if we refuse to believe that our senses and thoughts are unreliable, the natural default position is to assume that they are, since the only way we could ever find out the contrary would be through them, since they are our only ways of knowing and being conscious. So to disbelieve, we would have to believe, so either we believe or we believe. Why not believe? Especially since our thrownness forces us to make a choice.
3. The only way we can act is if we have something on the basis of which to guess what the outcome of that action will be. If we form beliefs about the world in the past based on attempting to reconcile as much of our sense appearances as possible while making as few assumptions as possible in the making of that theory, we have no better source of information about the world in the future than what it was like in the past. Since we have no better source of information, although the future might be different than the past, until we have reason to think so and information about what the change is, the null hypothesis should be the assumption that it will stay the same or similar, since we have no other source of information anyway and we cannot just act on no information at all or remain paralyzed. Furthermore, this strategy of loose induction is inherently self-correcting, as if we are wrong and something has changed, we will find out and change our beliefs. Thus, since induction is *prima facie* valid and prediction is the goal of knowledge, we should base our understanding and reconciliation of appearances on choosing a theory that best predicts all the facts using as few assumptions as possible, since if it best predicts all past facts, we have no reason to think it will not best predict all future facts, and even if it doesn't we can update our beliefs.. 

### Metaphysics

1. Subjects require subjectivity, and subjectivity requires an object. The object of that subjectivity cannot ultimately be the subject itself, because the subject needs to exist first for it to be there to be aware of. So to bootstrap consciousness there must be something outside of it which it is capable of interfacing with. That is the "world."
2. The world is what it is and does not owe us an explanation; whatever explanation we wring out of it is a victory for mind and sanity, a privilege not to be expected but to be celebrated.
3. Everything is what it is, else it could not be. We have no other way to know then by appearance, so let appearances stand for themselves ultimately. And how else does reality appear to us but in the form of material objects, epiphenomena stacked on epiphenomena? What need is there for anything else, that has been demonstrated?

### Ethics
1. Life's purpose is life itself: there is no purpose inherent in it, no meaning for it, but what it makes itself, yet the very existence of life requires that it value itself — else it would not have continued. That is enough to build on: the constant struggle. "We must imagine Sisyphus happy." Else, why are you still here to argue with me?
2. And why would we mourn this? Why would we want a universe that gives us objective purpose and meaning? Whatever purpose or meaning it could give would be just as cold, heartless, and uncaring as a universe without meaning anyway, because that is the nature of objectivity. At least this way, we can set our own course.
3. My ethics is the ethics of a doctor, who gives advice to a confused and obstinate patient. I have a good guess at what you desire and how to achieve it for you, for you are not some alien creature totally different from the rest of the human race. If you truly don't want what I have to give, leave me and everyone else in peace — for we have no reason not to defend our own desires to the utmost of our ability; after all, what else motivates us *but* those desires, so what could prevent us from defending them?
4. And what do we desire besides self-actualization? The achievement of all that we could be, the development and use of all the talents, skills, and knowledge at our disposal? Become what you are, and be true to it.
5. The one commandment I can give you is this: "Thou shalt not have regrets." Act in such a way that you will have no regrets, and if you fail to do so, learn from it but refuse to feel guilt or regret. That is the core of everything I do and ask others to do. Act on your sense of obligation, because your mind will hound you if you do not. Act on your love for others, lest you lose them or weep for them. Act in such a way that you would love yourself if you met yourself as another person. Act so that you do not give up anything you truly desire. Act mercilessly to claim what you truly want. Let nothing stand in your way. But plan. Do not regret.
