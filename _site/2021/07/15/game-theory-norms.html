<p>I discussed these ideas in a previous post, but ever since I made that post, they’ve been growing and clarifying themselves in my head in a process more akin to metastasization than processing, and I think today is finally the day that they’ve developed and clarified enough that it’s worth producing a second post. So, welcome to “The Game Theory of Egoist Societal Norms” version 2.0!</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In this essay I wish to examine what kind of norms (called equilibrium norms) would be enforced by a society of rationally self-interested decision-theoretic actors at an equilibrium point where no further change in strategy is needed. I will argue that the space of equilibrium norm sets that could validly create such an equilibrium is dominated (if not exclusively defined) by libertarian-adjacent (perhaps of both the left- and right- libertarian varieties) sets of norms. I will then wrap up with an analysis of what, if anything, is actionable about this theoretical analysis from the practical standpoint of an egoist in the current society.</p>

<p>This is, in essence, an attempt to do what John Rawls tried to do in <em>A Theory of Justice</em>, but better. It is beyond the scope of this essay to go into a detailed critique of Rawls’ analysis, but suffice it to say that in positing the original position, he essentially removed any normative force that whatever speculations he made might have had on the ordinary person; furthermore, he constructed the original position in such a way that it removed all of the interesting components of decision and game theory from the equation, resulting in an analysis that unjustifably only considers the interests of the lowest class in society, as if a one-sided set of norms can form an equilibrium system for a society with multiple dimensions to it. I seek to avoid these problems by applying game theory to the social norms of an <em>instantiated</em> set of rationally self-interested decision-theoretic actors, where the push and pull of different interests (and their relative sizes) creates a much more interesting dynamic system to analyze.</p>

<p>For those not familiar with game theory and decision theory, here is a list of definitions for some of the terms I’ll be using:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Game theory</strong>: the branch of mathematics concerned with the analysis of strategies for dealing with competitive situations where the outcome of a participant’s choice of action depends critically on the actions of other participants. [Note: used to analyze many individuals who all <em>use</em> decision theory.]</li>
  <li><strong>Decision theory</strong>: the mathematical study of strategies for optimal decision-making between options involving different risks or expectations of gain or loss depending on the outcome. [Note: used for/by individuals.]</li>
  <li><strong>Nash equilibrium</strong>: (in economics and game theory) a stable state of a system involving the interaction of different participants, in which no participant can gain by a unilateral change of strategy if the strategies of the others remain unchanged. [Note: these equilibria are particularly useful in social situations where an law-like substructure has not already been established as it prevents general violation of norms or a general competition between everyone as everyone pursues incompatible and oft-changing strategies.]</li>
  <li><strong>Focal point</strong>: (game theory) A solution that people will tend to use in the absence of communication, because it seems natural, special, or relevant. [Note: in bargaining, where communication is possible, a focal point is also very useful for preventing the bargaining from deteriorating or becoming unstable, as any selection which is not a focal point (and is therefore not unique) has many other similar but slightly more or less beneficial possible bargains, which both sides will then continue to argue for ad infinitum, whereas a focal point is unique and so once it’s selected, there are no obvious points that can be transitioned to from it. This is why a 50-50 split of things, for instance, is often selected when bargaining with another actor: it is obviously different from all the other splits that could be made.]</li>
  <li><strong>Commitment strategy</strong>: a strategy that is committed to such that it is pursued even when it is not the optimal strategy in an individual situation, because making it clear that one is committed to that strategy is overall a better strategy in the long run (usually due to bargaining). [Note: an example of this is making it clear that you will not negotiate with terrorists. If you analyze each instance of terrorists making demands on a case-by-case basis and make the optimal decision in each case (sometimes acquiescing to their demands and sometimes not), that will simply encourage more terrorists, as they’ll have a chance of getting what they want. If you, instead, make it clear that you <em>never</em> negotiate with terrorists, so there’s never a chance of them getting what they want, not as many terrorists will bother, and so you’ll end up losing out less overall even if occasionally you have to lose out in an individual situation.]</li>
</ol>

<p>Another term that I’ll be using, with my own ideosyncratic definition, is “the state of nature.” In this case, what I mean by the state of nature is a state in which nobody is enforcing norms toward anyone else, or if they are, there is no consistant effort with a critical mass of society to enforce the same set of norms, so everyone is just doing whatever is in their local self-interest.</p>

<h2 id="the-nash-equilibrium-of-society">The Nash Equilibrium of Society</h2>

<h3 id="how-society-enforces-norms-game-theoretically">How Society Enforces Norms Game Theoretically</h3>

<p>Every individual in society has an interest in preventing any other individual in that society from harming, not just themselves. If a man murders my neighbor, although this does not perhaps directly effect me, it indicates that this murder is a threat: if he has murdered my neighbor today, what prevents him from murdering me tomorrow? Furthermore, if I have good relations with my neighbor, then any harm to my neighbor means that my neighbor now cannot enter as beneficial reciprocal relations with me: if they are murdered this is obvious, but if my neighbor is maimed, this means that he cannot help me weed my garden in return for me helping him fix his roof. In addition, even if there is no chance that the man who murdered my neighbor will murder me later (perhaps this man is a racist, and will only try to kill black people, and while my neighbor is black, I am not), if <em>this</em> murderer gets away, that might put it in the heads of others who would like to murder people for their own gain (perhaps another racist who only kills white people) that, since the whole rest of society is not united behind preventing murders, they might just be able to get away with doing whatever murder they want to do. The logic of murder, as I’m sure you can clearly see, extends to any other active harm as well.</p>

<p>Every individual in society can have an interest in harming any other individual in that society as well, however. I can gain more, in some cases, by stealing my neighbor’s tractor from him, than by paying him for it, after all. (Why am I using so many weird rural analogies? Don’t know!) In this way, it seems, we have arrived at an impasse: a free rider problem, where everyone together has an interest in maintaining an order of norms, but where each individual also has an interest in defecting from that order, just as long as everyone else does not, as one person defecting cannot unseat the entire order of norms. It doesn’t matter if only <em>I</em> steal, that won’t undercut the entire system of property! It doesn’t matter if only <em>I</em> rape, it won’t lead to <em>everyone</em> raping! It is better, in essence, to be a criminal in a lawful society, than a lawful person in either a criminal or lawful society… or is it?</p>

<p>You see, free rider problems can only emerge when enforcement is not possible (or excluded from consideration), yet the entire situation we are dealing with here is one of enforcement! Thus, we arrive at a Nash equilibria, a combination of strategies on the part of all the different players involved in the game such that each player has no interest in switching strategies. In this case, I both have an interest in violating the norms for my own interests, and preventing anyone else from doing so. Yet, indeed, everyone else has this same exact set of interests. Thus, the fact that everyone else has an interest in preventing anyone from defecting from the social order of norms eliminates my own interest in defending myself, and my own interest (along with that of everyone else in society) in preventing defectors likewise eliminates the interest of any individual in defecting from these norms as well.</p>

<p>Therefore, the egoistic interest I have in helping in the maintenance of a social order of norms that prevents harm, when translated onto everyone else because of their similar interests, leads to everyone having an interest in not violating that order themselves as well (except in extreme cases, such as if I’ll literally die for sure anyway unless I violate the social order of norms). And our interest in committing crimes cannot outweigh our desire to prevent others from committing crimes towards us either, such that we reject our interest in preventing the risk of others harming us in order that we might harm others, for a number of reasons, not least among them the fact that whatever benefit we might gain from harming others (such as stealing from them) is itself made less valuable and put at risk by destroying the order that prevents others from harming us (such as stealing what we’ve just stolen). A thief only benefits from their thievery because the society around them is not in the habit of stealing — otherwise he wouldn’t hold on to his prize very long.</p>

<p>There is also something to be said here for commitment strategies as well (which David Friedman also covers in his lovely article, <a href="http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Property/Property.html">“A Positive Account of Property Rights”</a>). As an individual, demonstrating that one is willing to defend oneself — or what one considers one’s rights — to a degree disproportionate to the individual decision-theoretic calculation of the situation, actually decreases the overall amount of harm that one experiences, as it discourages all but the most risk-philic actors from even attempting to extort you or cross you. Doing likewise for and especially <em>with</em> one’s community likewise decreases the chance that any one of that community will be harmed, as the rest of the community will descend, in a severe manner, on whoever hurt one of their number. This can be directed toward an outgroup, but works just as well to prevent any members of the group itself from stepping out of line.</p>

<p>There are other considerations here, too, of course, that exit outside of game theory: the desire to model the norms one wants everyone else to adopt, as that makes it more likely for them to reciprocate, a sense of fairness or justice that might endorse these norms, and so on. I’ll leave those aside for now.</p>

<h3 id="equilibrium-norms">Equilibrium Norms</h3>

<p>One of the most important points about the way this Nash equilibrium works is that each individual, each of whom has a <em>prima facie</em> interest in violating the social norms of the society, also has an interest in preventing <em>each other individual</em> from violating those norms, and so will join in the enforcement against all others, or support alongside everyone else the construction of institutions which will prevent everyone else from violating those norms and which, since they are constructed by everyone else and therefore must be agreed to and contributed to by everyone else, must also prevent each individual themself from violating those norms. Thus each individual in society has an interest in breaking the norms, but they cannot band together, because they want an exception for themselves only. As soon as a situation is introduced into the system whereby enough people have no interest in enforcing the norms at all, or no interest in enforcing them toward a certain group (which may or may not include themselves), the whole nature of the game changes. Now, it is not a giant web Mexican standoff where each person stops every other person. Instead, the graph changes and two groups form, which may enforce norms toward each other but not toward the in-group, or which merely enforce different norms on everyone than the other group. Suddenly, the equilibrium is broken, because the individuals who want to break the social norms can now find enough people to be on their side that there is not an overpowering and very likely negative payoff (being arrested and punished or having to stay on the run) to violating those norms!</p>

<p>There are four criteria which a set of norms must (generally) satisfy in order to avoid breaking the equilibrium state in this way:</p>

<ol>
  <li>they must be intersubjectively unique and verifiable;</li>
  <li>they must be universalized;</li>
  <li>they must also be generally superior for all involved to the “state of nature”;</li>
  <li>and they must be focused on preventing positive harm.</li>
</ol>

<p>I will cover the justification for each of these criteria in order, below.</p>

<h4 id="1-intersubjectively-unique-and-verifiable">1. Intersubjectively Unique and Verifiable</h4>

<p>The first important component for a set of equilibrium norms is that they have to be an obviously unique point in the process of intersubjective bargaining that takes place between all of the actors involved in defining the social norms by choosing what to enforce toward everyone else. If the set of norms that is proposed is not a focal point for the bargaining process, then actors will, for their own interests, select similar (and therefore probably justified by the same or similar logic) points in the space of possible norms which are more beneficial to them, and since there are an almost infinite number of directions one can bargain in from a non-unique point, and a very large number of slightly and significantly differing interests in the society, each individual or even group of individuals will try to bargain in a different direction, breaking the equilibrium state. Even if the whole society ends up bargaining in the same direction, selecting a non-unique point in the set of possible norms means that the society will (either slowly or quickly) accelerate toward the next closest focal point as each intermediate point is too similar to the next point to have a unique argument for it as opposed to the other points.</p>

<p>Focal points in the space of possible norms can be generated by shared cultural beliefs. This is why, for instance, only white men being allowed to vote lasted as long as it did, although there is nothing logically unique about that point in the set of norms considering that whatever logic could be used to justify allowing white men the vote could be applied to pretty much any other competent adult human being. However, cultural beliefs themselves change over time, usually in the direction of a natural equilibrium point, as cultural beliefs themselves are a process of intersubjective bargaining between everyone in society, and if there is nothing logically unique about the point that cultural beliefs have selected, then they will be bargained toward a point that does have objective and unique arguments to be made toward it.</p>

<p>It is difficult to specify exactly what “intersubjectively unique” means in the context of sets of principles or norms, so although I’ll do the best I can, the best advice I can give is to analyze each set of norms presented to you individually and see if you can determine it for yourself. However, there are two general principles that can be used to spot a intersubjectively unique focal point for norms:</p>

<ol>
  <li>the set of norms must be the most consistent application of the principles, arguments, or justifications which are used to arrive at those norms;</li>
  <li>and the principles, arguments, or justifications used to arrive at those norms must themselves be unique enough that similar arguments cannot be easily made for (subtly or significantly) different sets of norms.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thus, for instance, if the argument for democracy is that everyone has a right to have a say in the laws which will be enforced on them, and furthermore that importing all of the local information about their own lives that each person has into the decision-making process of a government — since government is supposed to make the best overall choices for the society as a whole and all its members — then, as I said above, giving only a subsection of the population under that government the right to vote is not a proper equilibrium norm, because it violates the first criteria for intersubjective uniqueness: the justification that is used to push for voting rights for one group can equally be applied to all of the other groups. Likewise, democracy itself is not a proper equilibrium norm because the justification that is here used to arrive at democracy can equally well be adjusted to lead to anarchism with only minor changes: after all, if everyone has a right to a say in the rules they are governed by, why not have everyone choose those rules (as much as possible) themselves, so they do not have to totally live under rules designed by others; and if the point of a government is to serve the interests of the people and democracy is better because it integrates the situated knowledge of the individual into the process better, what else but a free market in protection agencies (mutual or otherwise) can subordinate the interests of the governing institutions to those of its members better?</p>

<p>Additionally, logically unique norm sets will generally be intersubjectively verifiable as well: the application of the norms will generally be clear in each situation, so that there are no major lacunae in the specification of outcomes from the set of norms, no underdetermination of decisions. Thus, norms which leave a lot to subjective interpretation or determination, or which can vary wildly based on small details that are not easily ascertained by those involved, are not logically unique, because although they might be unique in justification and consistent in philosophical application, they will not be actually unique in practice and will generally be underdetermined by the data available, leading to further disagreements generated by mutually incompatible bargaining vectors. Thus, the more concerete and less subjective the criteria for applying a certain norm is, the better a logically unique focal point it is. To use an example, this is why in sports we generally have nets or painted lines on the field or goalposts or whatever: this makes the conditions under which the scoring norms apply as objectively verifiable as possible. Instead of “is the ball <em>really</em> close to the edge of the field” or even “is the ball about three feet from the edge of the field” it becomes “did the ball pass the bright white line on the grass that everyone can see.”</p>

<h4 id="2-generally-universalized">2. Generally Universalized</h4>

<p>The second criteria that equilibrium norms must satisfy is that they must be insufficiently oppressive, or, put another way, generally universalized. The Nash equilibrium described above works by oppressing each individual individually, but in a way that is also beneficial to them because it also oppresses everyone else. As soon as individuals do not gain from the like oppression of everyone else, the equilibrium will start to break down and criminality will begin to appear. Thus, for instance, if we introduced a norm that prevented everyone from masturbating, for instance, leaving aside difficulty in enforcement, this oppresses each person individually, but not only do I have an incentive to violate this norm myself, I have no incentive to enforce it on anyone else because the violation of this norm on the part of everyone else doesn’t effect me whatsoever.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as soon as one <em>group</em> is oppressed over another, that entire group gains nothing from the like oppression of anyone else in the group, as they are all oppressed and cannot gain anything from being oppressed (the slave gains nothing from his master having slaves). Thus the entire group has an incentive to simply ignore the social norm that oppresses them, and in fact has an incentive to commit disproportionately to defending social norms which do not oppress them, to prevent further oppression. Of course, if the oppressed group is a sufficiently small minority of the overall population, the majority of the population can enforce those rules by force against them, but this is sacrificing the stability of the equilibrium still, as while the oppressed group might have an interest, thanks to the enforcement of the majority group, in obeying the social norms, they have no interest in enforcing or upholding or contributing to them, and an interest furthermore in uprooting these norms even if it costs them more than they gain to do so, as once a group begins to be oppressed, it will get even more so. This means that it puts the whole society at risk of continual rebellions and terrorism.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if we’re talking about rationally self-interested egoists instead of people who buy into arbitrary ideologies, the very minority status of the oppressed group undercuts any interest most of the society can have in maintaining the oppressive social norms! Think about it this way: if a gain is had by oppressing, say, twenty percent of a society, how will those gains be distributed? Either extremely thinly, such that the effort of upholding such oppression won’t be worth whatever you gain, or it will be concentrated in a corresponding twenty percent of society or so. But if the reason the minority can be oppressed at all is because it is below twenty percent of the population, then there is, by definition, no chance that the amount of people who benefit from the oppression will grow beyond around twenty percent either, so the chance that any of the majority group will be able to benefit from upholding those social norms is small enough that most won’t care to. This is similar to a point made by Marxists, but with a little more nuance, based on the fact that class mobility does exist, and that proper decision theory weighs chances of future reward, not just current status; if most of society doesn’t benefit, or has a very low chance of benefitting, from a set of norms, they won’t have any interest in upholding those norms. The reason poor people have an interest in upholding property rights, for instance, is for two reasons: first of all, upholding property rights only up to a certain cap, is not a very obvious bargaining focal point, but second of all, and more importantly for our discussion, because class mobility exists and so there is a non-negligable chance that the poor person won’t remain poor, and so will benefit himself from upholding those property norms. In the case of oppression of a minority group, however, since the range (and therefore chance) of the gain is proportional to the size of the oppressed minority, and that size must be very small for a civil war or terrorism to not be a significant negative factor, the chance of benefitting must be very small too, so it will be unlikely to be worth upholding for most of society. For instance, why would a poor white farmer in the antibellum South bother to return a black slave to his plantation? Historically, he’d probably do it because it was legally required and because he thought it was morally right, but if we exclude the second as ideology, and raise the same question for the first (why would anyone enforce that law), you realize that he has no interest in doing so.</p>

<p>Basically, then, we have a few factors at work that ensure that generalized universalization is required for equilibrium norms: first, if it oppresses everyone and nobody gains, it won’t last; second, if it oppresses a large enough group, the discord caused will be greater than whatever the gain could be; and third, if it oppresses a small enough group, it won’t be worth it for most people to uphold the social norms anyway.</p>

<h4 id="3-superior-to-the-state-of-nature">3. Superior to the “State of Nature”</h4>

<p>Another crucial part of what sustains the Nash equlibrium is that every individual actor has an interest in seeing everyone else follow the equilibrium norms, toward both themselves and others, even if they also each individually have an interest in being the only person to be able to violate these norms. Each individual actor could only have such a structure of interests if the set of norms, when generally followed by everyone in society, led to a greater expected value than simply not enforcing any norms at all, or enforcing a different set of equilibrium norms. Therefore, for a set of norms to be a feasible equilibrium point, they must lead to greater average wealth and safety for each person involved in the society than if there were no norms at all.</p>

<p>Most equilibrium norms of course, because of their stability, promote innovation, wealth generation, and confidence in people; furthermore, they will focus first on preventing harm, therefore largely eliminating that dimension from the payoff matrix for those living under their auspices. Meanwhile, in the state of nature, there are no norms against violence and there will be little to no stability, making wealth generation, confidence, and innovation difficult if not impossible. Thus, from a population perspective, the expected payoff of a society that has good equilibrium norms is much higher than one without. Compare the possible wealth outcomes (multiplied by their relevant probabilities) of a modern free market industrial economy, and a hunter-gatherer tribe, or of Marxism-Leninism.</p>

<p>Now of course, individual actors will have their own current positions under a set of equilibrium norms, which will perhaps only have a small probability of changing, and their own guesses as to what their status would be in a state of nature; however, I would argue that the range of stations in a state of nature which are superior to almost any station under an equilibrium normset is very small indeed. Hence, one would need to have a very low position in the hierarchy of the equilibrium normset <em>and</em> a very high expectation of ending up very high in the heirarchy of the state of nature in order for it to make sense to abandon the set of equilibrium norms. I contend, further, that it is impossible to really know or objectively assess where you’ll end up in a hieararchy in the state of nature, since it would largely be due to chance, meaning that when assessing that probability it should be calculated on the basis of the percent of the population of a state of nature which does actually end up at the top of the hierarchy, which is usually few indeed. Probably not higher than the probability of someone increasing their position under the equilibrium normset, to be honest. Additionally, it seems probable to me that for the most part those who end up on the lower end of a hieararchy under an equilibrium set of norms will probably also end up on the lower end of the hieararchy in the state of nature, although this is not necessarily or universally true. Thus, an equilibrium normset, in order to avoid even a single instance of someone rationally preferring no norms to equilibrium norms, should ensure that the probability of any given person moving up in the world from any position worse than “tribal warlord” is greater than the probability of any given person in the state of nature actually managing to be a tribal warlord who lives out a full lifespan.</p>

<p>This effectively prevents norms that enforce rigid hieararchies with no (or very little) mobility between different levels of the hieararchy, and in addition prevents norms which generate positions in society strictly worse (or as bad as) the worst position in the state of nature, or which (and this is easier to do for some reason) depress the average payoff of being in the equilibrium norms below the average payoff of being in the state of nature. The first corollary of this criteria rules out aristocracy, feudalism, and corporatism, whereas the second corollary rules out things like communism and Nazism.</p>

<h4 id="4-focused-on-positive-harm">4. Focused on Positive Harm</h4>

<p>The next important criterion that must hold for equilibrium norms is that they must be focused (at least, overwhelmingly) on preventing <strong>positive harm</strong>. Before I go into detail on why this is the case, however, let me first explain the difference between <strong>positive</strong> and <strong>negative</strong> harm within the context of social interactions. Consider a state in which there are two agents, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code>, that are in particular states with regard to their person and property. If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code> takes an action which transitions <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> to an inferior state to his previous state, such that the transition is a <em>direct result</em> of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code>’s action, then we call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code>’s action a <strong>positive harm</strong>. Here, a <em>direct result</em> is meant to imply that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>the harm was causally linked to the action <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code> took immediately (such as me stabbing you or knocking a building down on top of you); and,</li>
  <li>causally linked by a chain of positive harms such that it did not merely cause a negative harm to take place that would not have otherwise taken place, as the existence of the natural state of negative payoff which was not created by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code>’s action, and which would have made <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code>’s action not a harm at all had it not existed, means that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code> is not responsible for the actuality of that negative state transition, reality and the intermediate actors are; and,</li>
  <li>had <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code> <em>not</em> taken that action, the specific state transition that happened to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> after <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code>’s action would not have taken place at all, at least within any reasonable timeframe.</li>
</ol>

<p>Furthermore, for the action to be counted a <strong>positive</strong> harm, it must also directly worsen <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code>’s current state, not some hypothetical future state.  Importantly, we should also take note of the fact that positive harms, at least to be a relevant thing to enforce in the Nash equilibrium above, must be intentional, appear intentional, or at least the result of intentional negligence, otherwise the enaction of the positive harm does not demonstrate a general threat to others in the community, as it was purely unintentional and not preventable by greater care being taken either.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <strong>negative</strong> harms are harms which are the result of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code> <em>refraining</em> from taking action, allowing a preventable negative state transition in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code>’s person or property to take place, a state transition that was caused by no previous positive harm on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code>’s part (since if a negative harm is generated by a previous positive harm, it reduces to being a positive harm, such as in the case of kidnapping someone and locking them in a room, and then letting them starve: the starvation is a result of the previous positive harm of locking them in the room). It is important to note that nearly every human being is negatively harming another human being to some degree or another every second of every day, as a huge amount of people are experiencing some negative state transition on their person or property that some other person could have prevented if they had taken an action. Furthermore, although something which looks like a negative harm could take place unintentionally (as when someone is not aware that they could’ve helped someone else), let us say that an actual negative harm is still intentional, so it is a better mirror-image of positive harm.</p>

<p>There are some complications that I should introduce to this picture before I move on, however, as the line between positive and negative harm is one that pretty much defines the difference between left- and right-libertarians and it is a crucial line of conceptual analysis that must be carried out if we are to move forward with clear concepts in mind. For instance, what happens in a case in which multiple actors are involved? How do we assign blame and categorize harms then? For instance, to use an example often brought up by socialists of some kind, what happens if I start a new business which takes business away from my competitors, which are then forced to shut down from being out-competed and come work for me. Obviously, something I have done has harmed them (and I’ve gained from it to boot!), but have I committed a positive harm? In this case, I have not, because my original creation of the business itself was not a positive harm. The harm resulted from later consequences of that action, not in the action itself. After that, when my business begins redirecting business from its competitors, it is the customers’ free choice to take their money to me instead of them, and in doing so they are not committing a positive harm, as they are simply allowing the default course of events that would usually befall a business in the absence of customers (bankruptcy) to take place, instead of continuing the active help they were giving the business before, an intervention which was merely delaying what would inevtiably happen otherwise, by giving the other businesses their money. What, however, is the harm status of me continuing to remain in business after this phenomenon has begun to take place? Is me continuing to do business, now, a positive harm? Hardly. For, while my continued action is resulting in a negative state transition on the part of my competitors which is causally linked to my action and which would not have naturally ocurred without my action, it is not directly linked by a chain of positive harm, but instead by a chain of negative harm. I am merely enabling others to commit negative harm by not helping the other businesses, and as such there is a layer of other agents with actions of a different harm status between my action and the negative state transition. If, instead, I had started a gang, and ordered them to attack your business and break your windows, that would be a different story, as my actions caused a <em>positive</em> harm to you, not a negative harm, and so my action is related by a causal chain of positive harms to a negative state transition of yours, and so I would be directly responsible for positive harm being done, instead of merely responsible for negative harm being done.</p>

<p>With these definitions out of the way, why can enforced equilibrium norms only support norms against positive harm and not negative harm? One reason is that any particular individual committing a negative harm does not constitute a threat to anyone, as someone else can come along and help whoever is in need, and you only need one person to help you, not everyone in society. Negative harms only become problematic when <em>everyone</em> in a society commits them, so that no help at all is to be found. Compare this with positive harm, where positive harm is problematic to any given individual in society even if only one person commits it, so there’s no reason to weight until a critical mass of positive harm has built up to deal with the risk that person presents to everyone. Now, the second half of the case for norms enforced against positive harm being a Nash equilibirum for egoistic actors is that letting people in general get away with positive harm demonstrates an insufficient commitment to preventing it, which leads to other people committing more positive harm as well. This consideration does effect negative harms too, as it being commonly accepted that negative harm is allowed will likely lead to a situation in which everyone commits it. However, due to considerations below, I think enforcing norms against negative harm using force (therefore making them “equilibrium norms” by my definition above) is not an equilibrium state, so the most you could probably get is social norms enforced not by positive harm but instead by things like shame and ostricism against negative harm.</p>

<p>One of these considerations is that while everyone at all times has an interest in preventing positive harm or the risk of positive harm, not very many people are actually in the position of needing help and therefore fearing negative harm. Thus while everyone always has an interest in preventing murderers and thieves and so on, as that <em>always</em> causes a negative state transition, most people are not in a situation where a negative state transition is already happening or going to happen unless it is contraverted, so most people don’t care about negative harm. Therefore, the whole society versus individual dynamic that is part of what makes equilibrium norms work would break down in that case: only people who are currently in need, or think it very likely that they will be in need, have an interest in enforcing norms against negative harm, and those who are not currently in need — those on the receiving end of the enforcement — will all have an interest against enforcing these norms, thus bifurcating society and breaking the equilibrium.</p>

<p>On top of this, there is another important consideration: motivating people to give help to others (and thereby to not “commit” negative harm) requires doing or threatening positive harm on them, which therefore artificially increases the amount of positive harm in the system above the natural rate it would have just because of regular criminals and the force required to stop them. This is already a negative from the point of view of everyone who isn’t already worried about negative harm, as having more positive harm in the system means more risk and more problems. In fact, it should also be a serious concern for those who don’t need to worry about negative harm an extreme degree too, since positive harm is always worse than negative harm (even if you’re starving, getting shot still sucks). In essence, this leads to the rational egoist position, in cases of those not currently in need, to actually be enforcing against positive harm inflicted to prevent negative harm exactly as if it was positive harm inflicted by normal criminal behavior, since positive harm inflicted to fix negative harm doesn’t benefit those who are not in need, but it does represent a risk to them, so the logic is obvious. This consideration, again, breaks the equilibrium entirely.</p>

<p>There is an additional distinction between the positive harm generated by ensuring that negative harm does not take place that should be considered, too: while only using positive harm against those who first commit positive harm (criminals) is an obvious focal point for both practical (preventing crime) and justificatory (giving them a taste of their own medicine) reasons, once you introduce the idea of using positive harm against the general population who haven’t done anything wrong but have merely refrained from doing something other people would have liked them to do, it becomes difficult to justify not also using positive harm on the general population for a lot of other things, and suddenly the total amount of positive harm or threatened positive harm skyrockets. This means that norms that allow for preventing negative harm are norms that will naturally lead down the path toward less and less freedom for most people, and therefore more and more threats of positive harm in many parts of their lives, resulting in a situation that is probably worse than the state of nature. After all, in the state of nature, violence is sporadic and disorganized, and usually not constant as in continual, just constant as in recurring fairly often; meanwhile, in a situation in which a sort of totalitarian social control of many aspects of the individual’s life has been instituted, positive harm or the threat of it is a constant and universal factor, and is organized and efficient and always to be feared.</p>

<p>All of this is not to even mention the fact that usually, when people talk about preventing negative harm, it is to be done by a unilateral redistribution of wealth from one group to another (welfare), this is of course impossible given the previous criteria, which requires every group within the society to be treated roughly equally, so taking more money from one group to give to another group is out of the question. Instead, if it were to be valid at all, preventing negative harm would have to be done on an individual and case-by-case basis such that it applies to every individual in society, so that every individual in society is required to give aid to every other individual if needed. But this, of course, raises the question of what someone is to do who would be severly hurt by helping another person, and suddenly you have to do means-testing to make the social norm work, leading to a baroque and probably arbitary set of rules and institutions, and it spirals out of control again.</p>

<p>Plus, if there is a number of people who refused to help someone, who each individually could have helped him enough, who is at fault? Only one of them actually needed to help him, so who do we blame and punish? Indeed, since negative harm actually is only a problem when enough of society commits it, do we have a norm that suddenly switches from not punishing negative harm to punishing it (and back) depending on the percent of societal GDP that is being given to charity? That’s not something the first person to cause that percentage to fall below the percentage is going to agree to, and that could be anyone, so no one would want to take that risk, not to mention how arbitrary this seems. This is basically an unsolvable problem for all intents and purposes, and incidentally it <em>also</em> represents most cases of negative harm!</p>

<p>There are also proportionality considerations as well. It is usually fairly clear what a proportional punishment is for someone who has committed a positive harm, or at least what the upper limit for such a punishment would be. However, it is far from clear what should happen to someone who has “committed” a negative harm, especially since you’re essentially punishing people for <em>inaction</em>.</p>

<p>Therefore, consistent equilibrium norms that contain enforced norms against negative harm are generally not tenable for rationally self-interested egoists, and furthermore, they are generally not beneficial as well, as they are not a unique focal point like norms against positive harm are, so they’ll inevitably, if enforced, lead to more harm in total and less freedom and wealth.</p>

<h2 id="choosing-maximally-stable-equilibrium-normsets">Choosing Maximally Stable Equilibrium Normsets</h2>

<h3 id="two-caveats-and-an-observation">Two Caveats and an Observation</h3>

<p>Before I move on to examining the landscape of maximally stable equilibrium normsets, I think two caveats and an observation should be made.</p>

<p>The first caveat is that these criteria do not represent absolute, binary laws. It is possible to satisfy them to greater or lesser degrees; therefore, if they predict the stability of a set of norms, it is possible to be more or less stable, depending on the degree to which the normset actually satisfies these criteria. For instance, a normset that is not universalized at all is far less stable than a somewhat universalized normset, which in turn is less stable than a totally universalized normset. Additionally, it is possible to satisfy some of these criteria to greater or lesser degrees individually, and I don’t know what their relative importance is, nor how to establish that, and that might effect an analysis of suboptimal norms.</p>

<p>The second caveat is that there probably can be total exceptions to the generally positive correlation between satisfaction of these criteria and stability as equilibrium norms. I am not exactly sure what those exceptions would be, but the reasoning that I have been doing previously is normative and relies on the general rationality of the actors involved, so it allows for such exceptions. I will be leaving those out of my exploration of the landscape of maximally stable equilibrium normsets, however, because they’re almost definately extremely niche and not of interest to the general thrust of this paper.</p>

<p>The observation I want to make is that my analysis of these criteria actually generates some predictions and thus lends itself to some vague emperical confirmation or disconfirmation. In general, for instance, it indicates that — absent major limiting factors such as powerful indoctrination — over time society should as a whole bargain towards more universalizable and intersubjectively justifiable norms, as the inconsistency of non-universalizable norms is leveraged in favor of those who want to change it. And indeed, we do observe this. Furthemore, it predicts that societies which allow some focus on negative harm in their norms should over time begin to focus more and more on negative harm, becoming more authoritarian through a ratcheting effect; likewise, we see this borne out in history. There are many other such predictions made by my game theoretic analysis that are, in broad strokes, borne out. This indicates that it is probably a fairly good theory for predicting what norms will be stable in the long run.</p>

<h3 id="surveying-the-landscape">Surveying the Landscape</h3>

<p>In essence, since the criteria I’ve described proportionally determine the game-theoretic stability of a set of norms, maximally stable sets of norms would have to maximally satisfy these criteria (ignoring niche normsets). Now, there is a sort of hierarchy between these, in the sense that some criteria won’t matter much without the others being in place first; additionally, maximally satisfying some criteria (intersubjective justifiability) will lend to satisfying others (universalization). As such, here is a complete description of the way equilibrium norms would have to go about satisfying these criteria:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A maximally stable equilibrium normset would have to: focus on preventing positive harm to the person or property of each individual within society equally; draw the boundaries of person and property in a way that is clearly linked to things that are obviously linked to each individual involved (such as their body) and in a way that is unique and not subject to exceptions or qualifications that can make it a non-unique bargaining point; and design these boundaries and their enforcement in such a way as to maximize the average economic expected payoff for each individual in the society, and in a way which allows individual income mobility and avoids arbitrary stratification.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think, with this amount of specification, it becomes very clear that at the very least the majority of equilibrium normsets will be very libertarian in nature: focused on preventing harm to person or property, where person and property is derived ultimately (through the ideas of labor-mixing or retroactive slavery, etc) from the inviolability of the body, enforced equally across the board, with no groups getting special priviledges, and economically-aware (some property rights ideas fall into a gray area with the above, but are locked down by whether they are economically beneficial overall).</p>

<p>There are, however, many different types of libertarianism. I think a viable defense could be made for Mutualism, left-Rothbardianism, geolibertarianism, and a few other varients, although I do think that the kinds of libertarianism that specify different <em>kinds</em> of property have an uphill battle in demonstrating that this isn’t exception-making that can lead to gray areas and specification problems, as in the distinction that Marxism makes between private and personal property.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-this-mean-for-the-egoist">What Does This Mean for the Egoist?</h2>

<p>I’m not exactly sure, actually. I was primarily doing this analysis as an interesting intellectual exercise, to get an idea that I had in my head out on paper and perhaps present what I think is salvageable in the social contract tradition of Locke. I do think, however, that it raises some important points in favor of my views. For one thing, this demonstrates, at least in theory, that a society full of self-interested materialistic egoists could maintain functionality (even though I’m not actually advocating for such a thing), which means that you don’t really need religion, ideology, or anything else to get a society to hang together, at least not directly. Additionally, this makes the case for some kind of semi-free market society as something which an egoist should be aiming for given a predominance of other egoists, or given a goal of converting everyone else to egoists. Of course, an egoist could perhaps have the goal of making everyone else altruists in order to be served by them, in which case this analysis wouldn’t be of much help. Additionally, I think this makes the case that, to the degree that people act in a generally egoistic fashion, more libertarian norms will be more stable, and societies that don’t have them, or aren’t consistent with them, will tend to bargain fairly rapidly either away from them, or towards them.</p>
