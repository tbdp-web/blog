        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This essay has been on my mind for a long time. There is actually an embryonic form of it on this blog that I tried to write using voice dictation, but that just didn’t satisfy the itch, and so now that I’m feeling well enough to write and research real blog posts instead of voice dictated rants, I think its finally time to do this right.</p>

<p>My social views have changed drastically even in the past half a year or so (as those who know me can attest), but they have changed even more drastically in the last three years, tracking at a delay with my ethical, political, philosophical, and theological views. As such, this blog post is going to function in two ways: it is going to function as a documentation of my progress in learning how reality actually works, and a response to the people, like the old me, who are transphobic not out of inherent fear or bigotry, but instead out of simple and correctable ignorance, and who have a desire to learn, as I did.</p>

<p>This will take the form of a dialogue, where I will first, in bold, put forward the most challenging beliefs or questions my younger self had, and then I will explain why they are wrong. In essence, then: “Brain-Damaged Philosopher CALMLY DISMANTLES His Younger Self.” I hope you enjoy.</p>

<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Gender identity</strong>: The internal, phenomenological experience of gender that every person has. This is tied into their personality, their behaviors, desired presentation, how they interact with other people, their interests, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Gender</strong>: The external manifestation of gender identity, but also includes — to a certain degree, as you will see — physical aspects. Physical aspects are of secondary importance to gender designation, however, as will be shown.</li>
  <li><strong>Biological sex</strong>: Chromosomal content of the DNA. XX, XY, intersex, etc.</li>
</ul>

<div id="1"></div>

<h3 id="transgenderism-is-a-denial-of-basic-biology-you-cant-change-your-sex">Transgenderism is a denial of basic biology. You can’t change your sex.</h3>

<p>It’s a good thing, then, that no transgender person actually claims to be able to change their biological sex! Although transgender people generally try to get their bodies and appearance to match their gender identity, they of course realize that rewriting the chromosomes in every one of their cells is an impossible task. However, gender is not identical to biological sex, so it is possible to change gender without changing sex.</p>

<p>The reason they try to do this is because they, like cisgender people, have a phenomenological, internal experience of identity and self that is gendered; their phenomenological experience of identity simply does not match the gender usually associated with their own biological sex.  This phenomenological experience is both a behavioral thing — how one desires to speak, dress, act, relate to others, body language, etc — and also a physical thing — what body parts one expects or does not expect to have, and whether one looks like how one imagines oneself internally.</p>

<p>Lest you doubt that it is possible to have a gender identity, imagine for a moment that you woke up in the body of the opposite gender. Would you feel at home? Would things be where you expected them to be? Would you want to <em>act</em> like the typical person of the gender associated with that biological sex, or would you continue acting and dressing like <em>yourself</em> — acting and dressing like the opposite gender to the one associated with your new biological sex? Would you, perhaps, phrase it as <em>being trapped in the opposite gender’s body?</em></p>

<div id="2"></div>

<h3 id="if-transgender-people-dont-claim-to-be-trying-to-change-their-biological-sex-why-do-they-want-to-be-referred-to-as-of-the-opposite-gender-to-their-biological-sex">If transgender people don’t claim to be trying to change their biological sex, why do they want to be referred to as of the opposite gender to their biological sex?</h3>

<p>Gender, while it usually maps on to biological sex, is not defined purely in terms of biological sex. This should be obvious because of the fact that we can’t actually check the chromosomes of anyone we meet. Instead, we decide what gender to refer to them as, and treat them as, on the basis of how they act and present. A definition of gender purely in terms of chromosomal makeup is simply unusable.</p>

<p>Moreover, such a definition simply does not match how we use gendered words. After all, in the case of intersex people, there are people who look physically almost identical to men, but have XX chromosomes (and female internal sex organs), and people who look physically female but have XY chromosomes (and male internal sex organs), and we already refer to them by the gender they present and identify as, instead of the gender that matches with their genes. There are also truly intersex people who have chromosomes that are neither XX nor XY, and we refer to them as the gender they choose to present as.</p>

<p>Likewise, defining gender in terms of reproductive capacity instead of presentation simply does not fit how we actually use the terms either, as we do not consider infertile women, or castrated men, no longer women or men. Most people who are infertile, of either gender, would in fact view the reduction of gender to reproductive capacity, or specific sexual organs, as insulting, demeaning, and dehumanising, as would most non-infertile people. Reducing womanhood, for instance, to being a baby incubation machine is silly and ridiculous, the kind of socially regressive nonsense only a conservative could concoct. Likewise, if to a lesser degree, reducing a man to an insemination machine is also dehumanizing.</p>

<p>It is therefore clear from the above examples that the essentialist account of gender (and word definitions in general) simply fails. It does not describe how actual humans actually use language, as there are too many exceptions to any attempt to specify a specific set of binary properties that define what a word applies to. Instead, I think it is better — and I hold this position for philosophical reasons totally divorced from any social agenda I might have, I should add, based on my understanding of how proper abstraction and epistemology works — to view the definitions of words as a set of properties that can be satisfied to varying degrees, and different amounts of points are awarded to an object for satisfying those properties to various degrees. An object counts as having a certain word apply to it if the point score is obviously very high, and doesn’t count if the score is very low, but can fall into a gray area if the point score is in the middle. Think about whether cereal is a soup, or a hot dog is a sandwich. Like other words, then, gender actually refers to an entire nebulous and mostly socially constructed cloud of properties that can be satisfied to varying degrees, and as such, it is possible for a transgender person to fall under the definition of their preferred gender even if their chromosomes don’t match up. For instance, I think probably the most important part of gender is not the chromosomes, but how the person acts and thinks (their gender identity). After all, this determines more than anything else how well they fit in to the expectations and roles of a particular gender. So, since the gender identity and mind of a transgender person matches up with their preferred gender, they, in my opinion, <em>are</em> that gender in the way that matters most.</p>

<p>In partial demonstration of this, I should point out that throughout the world and its history, many cultures have had vastly different ideas about how gender works: presentation, role in society, whether men or women are the more rational gender, etc. Many cultures have also often accepted more genders than just two.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<div id="3"></div>

<h3 id="transgenderism-is-just-a-mental-illness-or-delusion-like-lycanthropy-not-an-actual-medical-condition">Transgenderism is just a mental illness or delusion, like lycanthropy, not an actual medical condition.</h3>

<p>First of all, transgenderism cannot be a delusion because it makes reference to an internal phenomenological experience of self, not an external state of affairs. Transgender people aren’t claiming that they are of the opposite biological sex (an objectively verifiable fact), like people lycanthropy are claiming that they <em>are</em> animals. They are instead describing an internal experience of expectation, identity, and emotion, and just like other first-person phenomenological experiences, one simply <em>cannot</em> be wrong about them. If I go up to a doctor saying I’m having a headache, it would be absurd for that doctor to tell me I’m not having a headache. The doctor could say that he can’t see a physical reason for the headache, but he can’t tell me I’m not feeling it.</p>

<p>Additionally, according to the American Psychological Association, a psychological state is only considered a mental disorder or illness if the state inherently causes significant stress or disability. For instance, if someone is having paranoid delusions or lycanthropy, it is inherently distressing to them, because they <em>do not want</em> to believe what the illness makes seem true to them. However, for transgender people, thinking of themselves as the opposite gender is not inherently distressing at all. Instead, what is distressing is “finding affordable resources, such as counseling, hormone therapy, medical procedures and the social support necessary to freely express their gender identity and minimize discrimination. Many other obstacles may lead to distress, including a lack of acceptance within society, direct or indirect experiences with discrimination, or assault.”<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Furthermore, more and more research is indicating that there are structural, functional, and metabolic brain differences between transgender people and those that share their biological sex, such that they either appear outside the norm of both genders or fully inside the norm of the gender they identify as. As such, the only possible objectively extant thing that transgender people could be said to be referring to when they describe their experience of gender identity and dysphoria, the brain, appears to confirm their stories. This their gender identity is not merely a delusion. Below, I will list several studies that confirm this.</p>

<h4 id="the-brains-of-transgender-people-operate-in-ways-more-similar-to-their-desired-gender-than-their-birth-sex">The brains of transgender people operate in ways more similar to their desired gender than their birth sex.</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>We revealed a cerebral activation pattern in MTF transsexuals compared with male controls similar to female controls compared with male controls during viewing of erotic stimuli, indicating a tendency of female-like cerebral processing in transsexualism.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>These data suggest a pattern of activation away from the biological sex [on the part of male-to-female transsexuals (MTFRs)], occupying an intermediate position with predominantly female-like features. Because our MFTRs were nonhomosexual, the results are unlikely to be an effect of sexual practice. Instead, the data implicate that transsexuality may be associated with sex-atypical physiological responses in specific hypothalamic circuits, possibly as a consequence of a variant neuronal differentiation. <sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="the-actual-neuronal-structures-of-the-brains-of-transgender-people-also-resemble-their-desired-sex-more-than-their-birth-one">The actual neuronal structures of the brains of transgender people also resemble their desired sex more than their birth one.</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>We showed for the first time that INAH3 volume and number of neurons of male-to-female transsexual people is similar to that of control females. The female-to-male transsexual subject had an INAH3 volume and number of neurons within the male control range, even though the treatment with testosterone had been stopped three years before death. The castrated men had an INAH3 volume and neuron number that was intermediate between males (volume and number of neurons P &gt; 0.117) and females (volume P &gt; 0.245 and number of neurons P &gt; 0.341). There was no difference in INAH3 between pre-and post-menopausal women, either in the volume (P &gt; 0.84) or in the number of neurons (P &lt; 0.439), indicating that the feminization of the INAH3 of male-to-female transsexuals was not due to estrogen treatment. We propose that the sex reversal of the INAH3 in transsexual people is at least partly a marker of an early atypical sexual differentiation of the brain and that the changes in INAH3 and the BSTc may belong to a complex network that may structurally and functionally be related to gender identity. <sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>While most people take identification with their body for granted, conditions such as phantom limb pain, alien hand syndrome, and xenomelia suggest that the feeling of bodily congruence is constructed and susceptible to alteration. Individuals with xenomelia typically experience one of their limbs as over-present and aversive, leading to a desire to amputate the limb. Similarly, many transgender individuals describe their untreated sexed body parts as incongruent and aversive, and many experience phantom body parts of the sex they identify with (Ramachandran, 2008). This experience may relate to differences in brain representation of the sexed body part, as suggested in xenomelia (McGeoch et al., 2011)…  [The findings of this study] suggest that dysphoria related to gender-incongruent body parts in FtM individuals may be tied to differences in neural representation of the body and altered white matter connectivity.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="some-of-the-neurological-structures-of-transgender-people-are-neither-male-nor-female-but-grow-to-match-their-preferred-gender-after-treatment-indicating-why-hormone-therapy-is-so-important-as-it-returns-the-brain-to-a-more-normal-state">Some of the neurological structures of transgender people are neither male nor female, but grow to match their preferred gender after treatment, indicating why hormone therapy is so important, as it returns the brain to a more normal state.</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Differences between male and female control groups were found only in the auditory RSN, whereas differences between both control groups and MtFs were found in the auditory and fronto-parietal RSNs, including both primary sensory areas (e.g. calcarine gyrus) and higher order cognitive areas such as the middle and posterior cingulate and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Overall, differences in MtFs compared with men and women were more pronounced before cross-sex hormonal treatment. Interestingly, rs-FC between MtFs and women did not differ significantly after treatment. When comparing hormonally untreated and treated MtFs, we found differences in connectivity of the calcarine gyrus and thalamus in the context of the auditory network, as well as the inferior frontal gyrus in context of the fronto-parietal network.<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The extant literature describing neuroimaging outcomes among transgender populations focuses primarily on questions of how similar the brain of the transgender individual is to their natal sex and whether use of GAHT [gender-affirming hormone therapy] enhances similarity between the brain of their natal sex and that of their desired gender. Most, but not all studies, indicate that the transgender individual is more similar to their preferred gender with respect to cerebral and gray matter volume and performance on gender-biased cognitive tasks (e.g., verbal and spatial tasks). There is a signal for GAHT to enhance the transgender individuals’ similarity to their preferred gender. <sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></p>

<p>First of all, let’s go back to the thought experiment above. Imagine you woke up in the body of the opposite gender. You look in the mirror and don’t recognize yourself. When you move, it feels off. You are disgusted and disturbed by your new genitalia and secondary sex characteristics, and they feel strange and unfamiliar, foreign. Furthermore, you simply don’t want to act or dress like most of the other people who share your new biological sex. Could someone convince <em>you</em> that something wasn’t wrong? Could they convince you to start acting like a man or a woman, even if it felt wrong and artificial and you weren’t good at it? Could they convince you to start liking having sex as the opposite gender, using genitalia that you are disgusted and disturbed by in ways that are foreign to you? No? Then why expect it of transgender people?</p>

<p>Furthermore, attempting to convince people they have a different gender identity (or sexual orientation) than they actually do has a long history. It’s called conversion therapy, and it is well accepted in the psychology community that it <em>does not work</em>, and might even be harmful.<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote">10</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:23" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote" rel="footnote">11</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:24" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote" rel="footnote">12</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="letting-transgender-people-get-surgeries-so-they-can-match-their-preferred-gender-violates-the-hippocratic-oath-to-do-no-harm-plus-transgender-people-could-really-regret-making-such-drastic-moves">Letting transgender people get surgeries so they can match their preferred gender violates the Hippocratic Oath to ‘do no harm.’ Plus, transgender people could really regret making such drastic moves.</h3>

<p>First of all, let’s just get one thing out of the way: just because someone does something they <em>might</em> regret, does not give anyone any license to discriminate against them, hate them, or anything like that. Also, as for the Hippocratic Oath, most medical schools don’t use it anymore. It has been overshadowed by more complicated medical codes of ethics and modified or entirely new oaths. Additionally, it should be noted that to claim that transgender surgery is ‘harm’ is to beg the question against the existence of transgender people, and moreover, we often do ‘mutilating’ surgeries (such as castration), when a greater medical need is known, and additionally doctors often perform cosmetic surgeries for no more reason than that the patient wants them.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we do things we might regret, even seriously, all the damn time. Buying a house can send you into debt so bad you could end up homeless. Driving a motorcycle could leave you a vegetable or seriously injured (as could driving a car, for that matter). Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce<sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote">13</a></sup>, and most of those are very ugly. Nearly half of men and women in the US have experienced psychological abuse by an intimate partner<sup id="fnref:12" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote">14</a></sup>. Are we trying to stop people from doing any of these things? No? Why just transgender people, then? Many of these things are just as irreversible as transgender surgery. Additionally, not all transgender people even plan on <em>getting</em> transgender surgery. After all, there are some risks involved, so even though they feel gender dysphoria and would want a body that matches their minds, they are aware of the risks.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it has been shown that gender affirming treatments greatly improve the mental health of transgender people:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We conducted a systematic literature review of all peer-reviewed articles published in English between 1991 and June 2017 that assess the effect of gender transition on transgender well-being. We identified 55 studies that consist of primary research on this topic, of which 51 (93%) found that gender transition improves the overall well-being of transgender people, while 4 (7%) report mixed or null findings. We found no studies concluding that gender transition causes overall harm. As an added resource, we separately include 17 additional studies that consist of literature reviews and practitioner guidelines.<sup id="fnref:25" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote" rel="footnote">15</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We identified 28 eligible studies. These studies enrolled 1833 participants with GID (1093 male-to-female, 801 female-to-male) who underwent sex reassignment that included hormonal therapies… Pooling across studies shows that after sex reassignment, 80% of individuals with GID reported significant improvement in gender dysphoria (95% CI = 68–89%; 8 studies; I2 = 82%); 78% reported significant improvement in psychological symptoms (95% CI = 56–94%; 7 studies; I2 = 86%); 80% reported significant improvement in quality of life (95% CI = 72–88%; 16 studies; I2 = 78%); and 72% reported significant improvement in sexual function (95% CI = 60–81%; 15 studies; I2 = 78%).<sup id="fnref:26" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>[quoting from an article about a study instead of the study itself because the article does a better job of boiling the information down] In this study there were 3,398 patients, 16 mentioned regret or detransition. 12 attribute this to social pressure, and only 3 de-transitioned with no intention to transition again. That’s 3 people from a sample of 3,398 trans people. That’s 0.088% of people sampled. Literally less than 1 in 1000 people seeking treatment to aid transition. Therefore the successful treatment rate is 99.92% of people treated being trans, and happy with the results of treatment.<sup id="fnref:27" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this first total population study of transgender individuals with a gender incongruence diagnosis, the longitudinal association between gender-affirming surgery and reduced likelihood of mental health treatment lends support to the decision to provide gender-affirming surgeries to transgender individuals who seek them.<sup id="fnref:13" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote" rel="footnote">18</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There was significant difference between transsexual individuals before surgery and after surgery in mean score of happiness (P&lt;0.01) (t=−4/84). Moreover, there was significant difference between the two groups in mean score of mental health (P&lt;0.01) (f=19/13).<sup id="fnref:14" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote" rel="footnote">19</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Current studies indicate that quality of life improves after sex reassignment surgery. The available studies are heterogeneous in design. In the future, prospective studies with standardized methods of assessing quality of life and with longer follow-up times would be desirable.<sup id="fnref:15" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote" rel="footnote">20</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dr. Hess and colleagues surveyed 156 people who had all had gender reassignment surgery 6.61 years prior to the study, on average. The survey included open-ended questions regarding the participants’ “general, optical, and functional contentedness” with the surgery. The participants were also asked about their psychosocial well-being and quality of life. The latter was assessed at two different points in time throughout the transition process. Overall, 71 percent of the participants reported feeling very satisfied with the “optical and functional results” of the surgery, with 76.2 percent of the participants saying that they were able to achieve orgasms. The authors conclude: “We could detect a distinct improvement of general and trans-specific [quality of life] and psychosocial resources in our transgender cohort within [the] transition process.”<sup id="fnref:16" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote" rel="footnote">21</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What about the claims of institutions like the Heritage Foundation? Quoting from one of their articles on the subject (warning for those who want to read the article: insane amounts of transphobia and misgendering are contained within):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When ‘the tumult and shouting dies,’ it proves not easy nor wise to live in a counterfeit sexual garb. The most thorough follow-up of sex-reassigned people—extending over 30 years and conducted in Sweden, where the culture is strongly supportive of the transgendered—documents their lifelong mental unrest. Ten to 15 years after surgical reassignment, the suicide rate of those who had undergone sex-reassignment surgery rose to 20 times that of comparable peers.<sup id="fnref:17" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote" rel="footnote">22</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem with this, of course, is that it misunderstands the <em>purpose</em> of sex-reassignment surgery. The point is to make life as a transgender person more bearable — which it demonstrably does. It is not, and no one has ever claimed it would be, a cure-all. Of <em>course</em>, if you were to find yourself in the body of the wrong gender, no matter how much you modified it, you would be unhappy with it. Additionally, the Heritage Foundation misreads the study they cite on several levels. First of all, the conclusion of the study outright says that SRS relieves gender dysphoria, which is what it is supposed to do:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Persons with transsexualism, after sex reassignment, have considerably higher risks for mortality, suicidal behaviour, and psychiatric morbidity than the general population. Our findings suggest that sex reassignment, <strong>although alleviating gender dysphoria,</strong> may not suffice as treatment for transsexualism, and should inspire improved psychiatric and somatic care after sex reassignment for this patient group.<sup id="fnref:18" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote" rel="footnote">23</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Second of all, just because Sweden is very LGBTQ+ friendly <em>now</em>, does not at all imply that it was in the 1970s, which was when most of the people who were studied transitioned. In fact, I find it highly implausible that it would have been even <em>remotely</em> transgender friendly at the time. Therefore, much of the increased mental illness seen in the transgender people studied when compared to the general population could well be from trauma caused in earlier life, from before Sweden was so accepting. Indeed, it could be trauma caused simply from having to live as the wrong gender for so long before they could get a surgery. Additionally, SRS techniques have come a very long way since the 1970s, which could certainly play a role in the mental illness of transgender people who had the operation at that time. Furthermore, the study was concluded in 2011. That’s a decade ago, and we’re still dealing with transphobia today.</p>

<p>It is simply untrue that children are being medically transitioned. Those under the age of eighteen (the age of legal consent) are not provided with hormone therapy or surgery of any kind. They are instead referred to a therapist whose job is — unlike paranoid conservatives seem to thing — not to support the child in whatever they want to do, nor to convince them to “become” transgender, but instead to figure out if they actually are transgender, and strongly avoid having them go through the difficult process of coming to terms with that if they are not <em>actually</em> transgender.</p>

<p>Now, yes, some children are given puberty blockers during this process, but this is in fact to <em>prevent</em> an irreversible and possibly quite harmful change. It gives the therapist and the child and the parents more time to figure out what to do, that’s all.</p>

<p>Additionally, I think it is clear that there is a difference between real dysphoria and the normal babble, play, and pretend of children.</p>

<h3 id="the-idea-that-there-is-an-inherent-difference-between-male-and-female-brains-contradicts-the-feminists-transgenderism-and-feminism-are-at-war-and-thus-we-see-how-social-progressivism-eats-itself">The idea that there is an inherent difference between male and female brains contradicts the feminists! Transgenderism and feminism are at war, and thus we see how social progressivism eats itself.</h3>

<p>It is not a universal, or even very common, belief among feminists that there is no inherent difference between men and women. There is a small group of radical feminists, who are generally rejected by other feminists and most of the rest of the socially progressive community, that deny this, but this does not imply that transgenderism is incorrect or that progressivism is a failure. This is tantamount to pointing out an ideological difference between different conservative ideologies — perhaps between paleoconservatives and neoconservatives — and using this as evidence that one or both are wrong, or that conservatism as an ideology is incoherent. Furthermore, these trans-exclusionary radical feminists (TERFS) are simply scientifically wrong. Here is a quote from the abstract of a meta-analysis (the strongest form of scientific evidence) on the subject:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Studies of perception, cognition, memory and neural functions have found apparent gender differences. These differences may be attributed to various genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors and do not reflect any overall superiority advantage to either sex. Both sexes are equal in intelligence, but tend to operate differently. Men and women appear to use different parts of the brain to encode memories, sense emotions, recognize faces, solve certain problems and make decisions. Indeed, when men and women of similar intelligence and aptitude perform equally well, their brains appear to go about it differently, as if nature had separate blueprints. Sex differences in the brain may play a role in learning processes, language development, and progression of neurologically-based diseases. Sex differences need to be considered in studying brain structure and function and may raise the possibility of sex-specific treatments for neurological diseases.<sup id="fnref:19" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote" rel="footnote">24</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In fact, many (most?) feminists seem instead to <em>emphasize</em> the inherent differences between men and women, talking about positive things that are unique to women and — in the case of care ethics at least — trying to construct philosophies that use feminine insights that have been absent in the philosophical canon so far due to its domination by men. What feminists dispute is that women are any less capable, intelligent, or rational than men. Not that they are different.</p>

<div id="8"></div>

<h3 id="we-shouldnt-let-transgender-women-compete-in-womens-sports-men-have-a-lot-more-stamina-and-strength-and-so-on-so-they-would-have-an-unfair-advantage">We shouldn’t let transgender women compete in women’s sports. Men have a lot more stamina and strength and so on, so they would have an unfair advantage.</h3>

<p>Most of the scientific studies I could find indicate that trans women remain stronger than the average cis woman even after they transition, although their strength does decrease significantly.<sup id="fnref:20" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote" rel="footnote">25</a></sup> However, this does not necessarily mean that trans women should not be included in women’s sports. For one thing, not all sports make the kind of extra muscle mass trans women have advantageous. For another, cis women who have hormone abnormalities that make them significantly stronger than normal cis women, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/tokyo-olympics-live-updates/2021/07/28/1021503989/women-runners-testosterone-olympics">such as Caster Semenya</a>, who have long been included in competition with their own gender would also be excluded from competition if we started deciding who could compete in women’s sports based on muscle mass or testosterone levels, etc. If you want to exclude trans women, you have to exclude some cis women too, if you’re going to actually base the exclusion on some scientific and performance basis. Meanwhile, if you simply <em>only</em> exclude trans women, then you are discounting that some cis women have the same biological advantage, and so it is clear that what you want is not a leveling of the playing field of biological advantage, but instead simply to act out your transphobia.</p>

<p>Moreover, in these discussions, trans men are never brought up, when they should be. If a trans man is on testosterone, he will be much stronger than equivalent cis women. This would seem to argue for trans men being allowed to compete with their desired gender, but trans women not being allowed to do so, which is strange.</p>

<p>I will admit that this specific issue is a bit of a problem. But the solution is not as obvious as conservatives like to think it is.</p>

<div id="9"></div>

<h3 id="if-we-have-to-respect-self-identification-as-a-certain-gender-we-could-end-up-letting-sexual-predators-into-the-bathrooms-of-the-opposite-gender-along-with-transgender-people">If we have to respect self-identification as a certain gender, we could end up letting sexual predators into the bathrooms of the opposite gender along with transgender people!</h3>

<p>First of all, if you’re worried about a man going to the bathroom with your wife/daughter/girlfriend, etc, think about how a real trans woman would feel going to the bathroom in the men’s bathroom, surrounded by actual men? Especially when most trans women pass as women, and there is a long history of men assaulting trans women?</p>

<p>Or imagine how uncomfortable it would be for a trans man to be in the women’s bathroom, presenting as a man? It will look for all the world as if there is a man in the women’s bathroom, <em>because there fucking is</em>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there is at least one study showing that public accommodation nondiscrimination ordinances simply don’t have any discernible effect on the actual occurrence of the crimes conservatives fear on this front:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This study presents findings from matched pairs analyses of localities in Massachusetts with and without gender identity inclusive public accommodation nondiscrimination ordinances. Data come from public record requests of criminal incident reports related to assault, sex crimes, and voyeurism in public restrooms, locker rooms, and dressing rooms to measure safety and privacy violations in these spaces. This study finds that the passage of such laws is not related to the number or frequency of criminal incidents in these spaces. Additionally, the study finds that reports of privacy and safety violations in public restrooms, locker rooms, and changing rooms are exceedingly rare. This study provides evidence that fears of increased safety and privacy violations as a result of nondiscrimination laws are not empirically grounded.<sup id="fnref:21" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote" rel="footnote">26</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Furthermore, one psychological study found that “sensitivity to pathogen disgust was positively associated with support for bathroom restrictions; sexual and injury disgust were unrelated. We also examined the role of disgust-driven moral concerns, known as purity concerns, as well as harm-related moral concerns in support for bathroom restrictions. While concerns about harm to cisgender and transgender people predicted support for bathroom restrictions, purity was a much stronger predictor. Also, purity partially mediated the link between pathogen disgust and support for bathroom restrictions, even after accounting for harm concerns. Findings and implications are discussed.”<sup id="fnref:22" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote" rel="footnote">27</a></sup></p>

<p>In addition, a scenario where a sexual predator crossdresses and uses this to sneak into the bathrooms of the opposite gender is just really far-fetched and unlikely. It seems like conservatives are more just grossed out by transgender people than they are actually concerned about something like this happening.</p>

<div id="10"></div>

<h3 id="there-never-used-to-be-transgender-people-but-now-their-numbers-are-increasing-rapidly-trans-acceptance-is-just-encouraging-confused-people">There never used to be transgender people, but now their numbers are increasing rapidly. Trans acceptance is just encouraging confused people.</h3>

<p>Do you think someone could convince <em>you</em> that you had a different gender identity? No? Then why do you think it’s possible for others?</p>

<p>Furthermore, if you want to start transitioning in a way that is even remotely irreversible — hormone therapy, gender affirmation surgery — you have to first speak with a psychologist, who will try to establish that you actually have gender dysphoria, and who will walk you through all of the dangers and downsides of transitioning. Only after they have given you the go-ahead, usually after two or more visits, can you even begin the process. Then, when you are approved, you are given hormones, but doctors calibrate them very carefully to your physiology, and will only give them to you if you are healthy to begin with. You will get regular checkups to make sure everything is going fine and nothing dangerous is happening. Only after you have been living as the opposite gender and taking hormones for <em>at least</em> a year will doctors even consider giving you surgery. This is to make sure that you are <em>absolutely positive</em> that this is the right move.<sup id="fnref:28" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote" rel="footnote">28</a></sup></p>

<p>So it’s not as if someone can just get an idea in their head from watching media or whatever and run off and do irreversible damage to themselves. The worst case scenario for a confused cis person is that they socially transition for a bit — wearing the clothes and using the pronouns of the opposite gender — realize it isn’t for them, and give up. And even that is likely very rare, for exactly the reason that gender identity is a very innate, phenomenological experience that isn’t really changeable.</p>

<p>So why are we seeing an increase of transgender people, if more aren’t being created by society “pushing the gay agenda”? We are seeing an increase for the same reason that we saw an increase in left-handed people after left-handedness stopped being stigmatized and schools and parents stopped trying to teach left-handed people to use their right hand to do things<sup id="fnref:29" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote" rel="footnote">29</a></sup>: more people are openly <em>admitting</em> that they are transgender, both to themselves, and to others. Transgender people always existed, they just didn’t show up in society and on polls because they were hiding, or even suppressing, their true natures. This explains the data just as well as the theory that people are “becoming” transgender, but it does not require dubious psychological assumptions. Furthermore, it better explains why there is a phenomenon of older people born in less accepting generations transitioning now, in the modern day.</p>

<div id="11"></div>

<h3 id="be-that-as-it-may-i-refuse-to-respect-the-chosen-namespronouns-of-transgender-people-respect-must-be-earned">Be that as it may, I refuse to respect the chosen names/pronouns of transgender people. Respect must be earned!</h3>

<p>Even if you disagree with what I have said in the previous sections about transgender people actually <em>being</em> their preferred gender in the way that matters most — such that not using the correct pronouns would actually make <em>you</em> the confused and incorrect one — there are other considerations. Do you run around insulting people as much as you want, whenever you want, until they <em>earn</em> your respect? No? Why? Because insulting people is harmful and rude? Well, so is using the wrong pronoun, as it can actually create severe psychological distress, similar to calling someone the N-word or the F-word. Also, if someone asks you to call them by a nickname, do you just completely ignore them, and rant about how they haven’t earned your respect or that their <em>real</em> name isn’t that name? No? Then why do it to transgender people? It seems, in the case of names and pronouns, that conservatives actually want a suspension of the normal rules of social decency and empathy. That seems odd, if their basis for doing so is supposedly in not letting transgender people change the rules. (It isn’t, it’s based in transphobia.)</p>

<p>Imagine that someone’s given name is tied up in very traumatic and hurtful memories — perhaps they grew up in a strict fundamentalist religious household and have real trauma connected to religious abuse — for them. If they ask you to use a nickname instead, would you refuse to use it, because it isn’t their “actual” name? No? Then why not use the “nicknames” that trans people use? Not to mention that many trans people actually get their name legally changed. Are you going to refuse to use their actual name merely because you don’t think that their name matches how they look? If so, why do you not just arbitrarily rename people based on how they look to you in general?</p>

<div id="12"></div>

<h3 id="transgenderism-is-equivalent-to-transracialism-or-transpeciesism-or-transageism">Transgenderism is equivalent to ‘transracialism’ or ‘transpeciesism’ or ‘transageism’.</h3>

<p>This is a false equivalency, and a very dangerous and harmful one at that.</p>

<p>The problem with the first equivocation is that while gender is an inherently internal, phenomenological experience of self and identity — which usually shows up very early in a child’s development and is very consistent when it does<sup id="fnref:30" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote" rel="footnote">30</a></sup> — race is defined purely in terms of external, physical characteristics. There is no internal experience that people of color have that inherently is different from white people, no ‘what it is like to be black’ that differs from the general human experience apart from <strong>externally imposed</strong> sociocultural factors, and no inherent behavioral or cognitive differences either. There is no such thing as ‘acting black’ or ‘acting white’, only acting like the cultures that are generally <em>associated</em> with those races. Therefore, there is <strong>no way</strong> for race dysphoria to exist: there is no internal marker that someone could have that would tell them that they are the ‘mind’ of a black person in a white person’s body, for instance. They could <em>like the culture</em> of another race more or identify it more, but that’s not being transracial, that’s wanting to imitate a different culture, and that happens all the time. It’s cringey, sure, but there are white rappers and black Vikings and nobody really cares that much. Since there is no way for race dysphoria to exist, those who are trying to be “transracial” are clearly doing it for some other reason, and that reason is probably not exactly wholesome, hence the vitriol.</p>

<p>The problem with the second equivocation is similar. There is nothing that it is ‘like’ to be a dog or a cat. They’re not conscious creatures. Nor is it possible for a human’s brain to resemble a dog or a cat more than a human brain. There can’t be such a thing as species dysphoria. Furthermore, taking on the roles and behaviors of animals just isn’t possible, healthy, or advisable for a member of the human species, whereas the roles and behaviors of the genders are specifically possible for human beings and taking them on isn’t inherently harmful regardless of your biological sex.</p>

<p>As for transageism, well, that’s a different thing entirely. If your mind actually does resemble that of a younger or older person, that’s an occurrence that we actually recognize and deal with accordingly: if an adult’s mind resembles that of a child, they are mentally impaired and are usually given caretakers. Likewise if a young person’s mind starts resembling a person of a much older age, such as developing dementia, this is not denied, but instead treated. In between these extremes, people often do not act ‘their age,’ acting in more or less mature ways, dressing in more or less mature ways, etc, and nobody bats an eye. This could be seen as ‘transitioning’ to a different age. However, again, like in the previous examples, outside of the extremes of age there really isn’t a set phenomenological experience that characterizes ‘what it is like to be a certain age,’ and therefore no internal phenomenological markers that can make someone transage.</p>

<p>Furthermore, for all three of these examples, the people that exemplify them — and necessarily all people that do — do so as an active choice. They choose to identify as something else, instead of already, necessarily identifying as that thing. Furthermore, when they ‘transition,’ they faced no serious psychological distress (unlike transgender people) if they did not do so. They simply wanted to, for whatever reason. This is very different.</p>
