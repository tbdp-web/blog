<meta name="description" content="1  Many seem to think that the only antidote to nihilism is tyranny: tyranny of the political sphere — after the mold of fascist Germany and Italy, which sought to repair the social fabric through the enforcment of a common culture, set of values, and religion — or, what is little different, tyranny of the intellectual sphere through a wholehearted and psuedo-philosophical embrace of the “metaphorical substrate” that some believe has heretofore been the source of the West’s success.  2  Given a choice between tyranny and nihilism, I’ll choose the latter any day of the week. People only think they need a rigid order of imposed meaning. It’s something that they’ve been convinced they need, but only because they’ve been part of it for so long they have forgotten what it’s like to be truly free. I would far rather be able to have the choice of meaning and purpose for myself, to chart my own course and be fully free to follow my mind and the rigors of my philosophies wherever they might lead, then to have my every end and my every thought predetermined by something outside of myself that has no  care for what or who I am or the truth of reality.  3  Nihilism is not inherently weak, not inherently incapable of responding to tyranny, as some might claim, either. A population of people who will not accept authority because there cannot be any justification for it outside of whether it is convenient to them, who will not accept imposed order because no such thing is any necessary part of the universe, who look at people who tell them what to do and what the meaning of something is as idiots, is a population that is not going to accept tyranny anymore easily then they will accept anything else, and is in fact a group that will, naturally and without an organizing force, rebel in unison against a tyranny being imposed.  4  Nietzsche himself was no nihilist. He viewed nihilism as something to be moved through and overcome. The fact remains, however, that his suggestion for overcoming nihilism was merely a full embracing: of what it actually means to be a nihilist, but also of what it means to be a being that is capable of assigning meaning to things, finding joy in things, and governing one’s own actions.

There is nothing set out before us that is foreordained, no law of the universe that can tell us “this is physically possible, but thou shalt not” nor “this is physically impossible, but thou shalt, and shall be punished for failing.” We make our own purposes, follow our own desires, and nobody can tell us “shall” or “shall not” outside of helping us understand better what it is we do want and how to grasp it.

As long as we have this fear, this revultion in causing suffering, we need not fear the atrocities that the religious promise nihilism will bring about.

Nihilism, you see, has two meanings: one, the rejection of inherent value and meaning, and two, the rejection of all possible value and meaning and the subsequent negative pessimism that comes with such a rejection. The only reason that the term has come to have these two meanings (and sometimes the term loses the second meaning, such as in the case of “moral nihilism”) is because of the strong assumption in people’s minds that the former meaning implies the latter. That is why the existentialists were forced to find a new word to describe what they were doing. But if we can disassociate the two meanings of the word nihilism, and claim the word for the first meaning alone and find a new word (like pessimism or negativism) for the second meaning, we can hopefully obliterate this intuition as well, and allow existentialism its proper place as the secondary definition of nihilism, as the actual natural and proper result of the primary definition. After all, nothing matters — and it doesn’t matter that nothing matters.">

    <meta itemprop="description" content="1Many seem to think that the only antidote to nihilism is tyranny: tyranny of the political sphere — after the mold of fascist Germany and Italy, which sought to repair the social fabric through the enforcment of a common culture, set of values, and religion — or, what is little different, tyranny of the intellectual sphere through a wholehearted and psuedo-philosophical embrace of the “metaphorical substrate” that some believe has heretofore been the source of the West’s success.2Given a choice between tyranny and nihilism, I’ll choose the latter any day of the week. People only think they need a rigid order of imposed meaning. It’s something that they’ve been convinced they need, but only because they’ve been part of it for so long they have forgotten what it’s like to be truly free. I would far rather be able to have the choice of meaning and purpose for myself, to chart my own course and be fully free to follow my mind and the rigors of my philosophies wherever they might lead, then to have my every end and my every thought predetermined by something outside of myself that has no  care for what or who I am or the truth of reality.3Nihilism is not inherently weak, not inherently incapable of responding to tyranny, as some might claim, either. A population of people who will not accept authority because there cannot be any justification for it outside of whether it is convenient to them, who will not accept imposed order because no such thing is any necessary part of the universe, who look at people who tell them what to do and what the meaning of something is as idiots, is a population that is not going to accept tyranny anymore easily then they will accept anything else, and is in fact a group that will, naturally and without an organizing force, rebel in unison against a tyranny being imposed.4Nietzsche himself was no nihilist. He viewed nihilism as something to be moved through and overcome. The fact remains, however, that his suggestion for overcoming nihilism was merely a full embracing: of what it actually means to be a nihilist, but also of what it means to be a being that is capable of assigning meaning to things, finding joy in things, and governing one’s own actions. In essence it was an overcoming of the worst parts of nihilism and an embracing of the best parts, in something that looks nihilist in comparison to the rigid imposed orders of things like Christianity, but which is nevertheless far better than the primitive nihilism that one must move through first to arrive. In this, I think, Nietzsche was right even though he perhapswas not fully aware of the fact: perhaps in staring into that abyss and allowing it to find a nesting place in our hearts, we can gain new freedom and resilience. Perhaps nihilism, when understood properly, is not so evil a thing after all?5Primitive nihilism is only a substantial problem for those who have been brought up religious or in a culture of religious values which assumes that without the existence of the ontologically nonsensical concept of objective value, it is impossible to be happy, find meaning, communicate, or do anything else. That is why you see definitions of nihilis that state in the same breath that nihilism is rejection of inherent meaning and value, and that nihilism is also a rejection of all meaning and value and a hatred of all things and a sort of radical solipsism.6The dependence on religion and objective value that religions have instilled in human beings is probably the greatest crime that religion has ever perpetrated. Nothing else has been born in the childhood of our race that could cast such a monsterous shadow for so long. I think the birth of one such hellish demon is enough to call that time cursed. All the other effects of religion were and are made possible by this first crime, that of granting moral superiority and earthly authority to the priests because without them, so they tell us, we cannot even know that murder is wrong. Indeed, even as the great crimes of religion begin to fade and lessen, we are left with this all-too-bitter aftertaste, the spectre of primitive nihilism which has cast its shadow over the twentieth and twenty-first centuries: the panic that, now that God is dead, perhaps there is nothing left to us but to fade into barbarism and horror.7Nihilism, properly understood, is a beautiful thing. There is nothing set out before us that is foreordained, no law of the universe that can tell us “this is physically possible, but thou shalt not” nor “this is physically impossible, but thou shalt, and shall be punished for failing.” We make our own purposes, follow our own desires, and nobody can tell us “shall” or “shall not” outside of helping us understand better what it is we do want and how to grasp it. We make meaning, we don’t play gods, we are gods. The lack of imposed shalls and shall nots, imposed purpose and meaning, does not mean that there is no meaning. Our minds are meaning generating machines, that’s all they do, and they do it in service of purpose, because we are beings built with purpose inside us.8The very fact that we fear the religious description of nihilism shows us why we should not fear nihilism: it demonstrates that we are social creatures who genuinely fear causing suffering. As long as we have this fear, this revultion in causing suffering, we need not fear the atrocities that the religious promise nihilism will bring about. For they have sold us a poison and called it an antidote: the poison that tells us that we are inherently sinful, and that it was religion that gave us empathy and principle, when we only find religion attractive as an alternative to nihilism because we first had this fear. Religion has stolen our nature from us, and sold it back to us at a price. A price that is much too high.

<p>Many seem to think that the only antidote to nihilism is tyranny: tyranny of the political sphere — after the mold of fascist Germany and Italy, which sought to repair the social fabric through the enforcment of a common culture, set of values, and religion — or, what is little different, tyranny of the intellectual sphere through a wholehearted and psuedo-philosophical embrace of the “metaphorical substrate” that some believe has heretofore been the source of the West’s success.</p>

<h2 id="2">2</h2>

<p>Given a choice between tyranny and nihilism, I’ll choose the latter any day of the week. People only think they need a rigid order of imposed meaning. It’s something that they’ve been convinced they need, but only because they’ve been part of it for so long they have forgotten what it’s like to be truly free. I would far rather be able to have the choice of meaning and purpose for myself, to chart my own course and be fully free to follow my mind and the rigors of my philosophies wherever they might lead, then to have my every end and my every thought predetermined by something outside of myself that has no  care for what or who I am or the truth of reality.</p>

<h2 id="3">3</h2>

<p>Nihilism is not inherently weak, not inherently incapable of responding to tyranny, as some might claim, either. A population of people who will not accept authority because there cannot be any justification for it outside of whether it is convenient to them, who will not accept imposed order because no such thing is any necessary part of the universe, who look at people who tell them what to do and what the meaning of something is as idiots, is a population that is not going to accept tyranny anymore easily then they will accept anything else, and is in fact a group that will, naturally and without an organizing force, rebel in unison against a tyranny being imposed.</p>

<h2 id="4">4</h2>

<p>Nietzsche himself was no nihilist. He viewed nihilism as something to be moved through and overcome. The fact remains, however, that his suggestion for overcoming nihilism was merely a full embracing: of what it actually means to be a nihilist, but also of what it means to be a being that is capable of assigning meaning to things, finding joy in things, and governing one’s own actions. In essence it was an overcoming of the worst parts of nihilism and an embracing of the best parts, in something that looks nihilist in comparison to the rigid imposed orders of things like Christianity, but which is nevertheless far better than the primitive nihilism that one must move through first to arrive. In this, I think, Nietzsche was right even though he perhapswas not fully aware of the fact: perhaps in staring into that abyss and allowing it to find a nesting place in our hearts, we can gain new freedom and resilience. Perhaps nihilism, when understood properly, is not so evil a thing after all?</p>

<h2 id="5">5</h2>

<p>Primitive nihilism is only a substantial problem for those who have been brought up religious or in a culture of religious values which assumes that without the existence of the ontologically nonsensical concept of objective value, it is impossible to be happy, find meaning, communicate, or do anything else. That is why you see definitions of nihilis that state in the same breath that nihilism is rejection of <em>inherent</em> meaning and value, and that nihilism is also a rejection of all meaning and value and a hatred of all things and a sort of radical solipsism.</p>

<h2 id="6">6</h2>

<p>The dependence on religion and objective value that religions have instilled in human beings is probably the greatest crime that religion has ever perpetrated. Nothing else has been born in the childhood of our race that could cast such a monsterous shadow for so long. I think the birth of one such hellish demon is enough to call that time cursed. All the other effects of religion were and are made possible by this first crime, that of granting moral superiority and earthly authority to the priests because without them, so they tell us, we cannot even know that murder is wrong. Indeed, even as the great crimes of religion begin to fade and lessen, we are left with this all-too-bitter aftertaste, the spectre of primitive nihilism which has cast its shadow over the twentieth and twenty-first centuries: the panic that, now that God is dead, perhaps there is nothing left to us but to fade into barbarism and horror.</p>

<h2 id="7">7</h2>

<p>Nihilism, properly understood, is a beautiful thing. There is nothing set out before us that is foreordained, no law of the universe that can tell us “this is physically possible, but thou shalt not” nor “this is physically impossible, but thou shalt, and shall be punished for failing.” We make our own purposes, follow our own desires, and nobody can tell us “shall” or “shall not” outside of helping us understand better what it is we do want and how to grasp it. We make meaning, we don’t play gods, we <em>are</em> gods. The lack of imposed shalls and shall nots, imposed purpose and meaning, does not mean that there is no meaning. Our minds are meaning generating machines, that’s all they do, and they do it in service of purpose, because we are beings built with purpose inside us.</p>

<h2 id="8">8</h2>

<p>The very fact that we fear the religious description of nihilism shows us why we should not fear nihilism: it demonstrates that we are social creatures who genuinely fear causing suffering. As long as we have this fear, this revultion in causing suffering, we need not fear the atrocities that the religious promise nihilism will bring about. For they have sold us a poison and called it an antidote: the poison that tells us that we are inherently sinful, and that it was religion that gave us empathy and principle, when we only find religion attractive as an alternative to nihilism because we <em>first</em> had this fear. Religion has stolen our nature from us, and sold it back to us at a price. A price that is much too high. I, for one, will no longer pay that price.</p>

<h2 id="9">9</h2>

<p>I call this attitude of mine nihilism and not existentialism for an important reason: I am attempting to engage in a linguistic reclamation project. Nihilism, you see, has two meanings: one, the rejection of inherent value and meaning, and two, the rejection of all possible value and meaning and the subsequent negative pessimism that comes with such a rejection. The only reason that the term has come to have these two meanings (and sometimes the term loses the second meaning, such as in the case of “moral nihilism”) is because of the strong assumption in people’s minds that the former meaning implies the latter. That is why the existentialists were forced to find a new word to describe what they were doing. But if we can disassociate the two meanings of the word nihilism, and claim the word for the first meaning alone and find a new word (like pessimism or negativism) for the second meaning, we can hopefully obliterate this intuition as well, and allow existentialism its proper place as the secondary definition of nihilism, as the actual natural and proper result of the primary definition. After all, nothing matters — and it doesn’t matter that nothing matters.</p>
