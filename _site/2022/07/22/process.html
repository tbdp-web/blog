<p>C<a href="https://blog.alexispurslane.xyz/2022/07/10/anarchic-encounter.html">onditions, not conclusions</a>: this, I think, is the striking insight at the heart of the insurrectionary anarchism that descends from Stirner and Novatore, and the mutualism that inherits Proudhon’s social science. The point of anarchism is that there is no “point” — no final destination, no social plan. You cannot “achieve anarchism” because anarchism is an eternal struggle against <a href="https://blog.alexispurslane.xyz/2022/07/18/power-and-hierarchy.html">hierarchy, authority, and domination</a>. Not an eternal war to maintain the order of things as they are or must be, but one that fertilizes the soil from which new things will spring with its blood — which spends its energy to protect the space within which individuals can arrange themselves, can find new ways to do things that work for them. The eternal war to make the anarchic encounter possible.</p>

<p>Novatore said that “every society you build will have its fringes,” and that on the fringes of every society, heroic intellectual vagabonds will wander “only able to live by preparing ever new and terrible outbreaks of rebellion,” and I agree with him. Moreover I think that this attitude of being open to change and willing to make it happen is both fundamentally necessary for the project of anarchism to maintain internal consistency, and a natural result of the way I look at social forces as a whole, my Neo-Proudhonian and egoist synthesis. In this essay, I want to dig into that a little.</p>

<h2 id="from-rebels-to-reactionaries">From Rebels to Reactionaries</h2>

<p>What is the difference between an insurrection and a revolution? The answer is contained within the words themselves: a revolution aims at <em>revolving</em> the wheel of history — at establishing new social institutions to replace the old, unsatisfactory ones — while an insurrection is, instead, a rejection of any establishment of specific institutions at all, any subjugation of individual will to a social plan. Thus, as Stirner says, “the revolution is aimed at new arrangements, while the insurrection leads us to no longer let ourselves be arranged, but rather to arrange ourselves.” Insurrection throws off domination, thumbs its nose at authority, and flattens hierarchy — <em>and that is all it does</em>; beyond that, it is up to those who are now left over, equal and free, to decide what to do. Revolution may do the same as insurrection, but it has a goal in mind, a final end-state it wishes to achieve, and thus a contradiction — the introduction of a hierarchy in Stirner’s sense: subjugation of the individual to an idea.</p>

<p>Of course, most anarchists today are not really so naive and intellectually authoritarian as to proclaim that only their set of anarchist social structures are valid, and that all others must be prevented along with the rise of any sort of hierarchy; the “anarchism without adjectives” movement has progressed far in anarchist circles. Yet you can probably find many a vulgar communist anarchist or left-wing market anarchist here and there who still thinks in a purely revolutionary way. You can even often find echoes of this thinking in the thinking of those who, on the whole, know better. There can often be a fine line between a proposal of how things <em>could</em> work, or how you would like them to work in the community you live in, or how things <em>probably</em> might look given material reality and how humans behave, and giving a plan for how things should look universally.</p>

<p>Nevertheless I think it is still worth highlighting the dangers of revolutionary, as opposed to insurrectionary, thinking: when you become convinced that your way of organizing individual and social forces, or your specific social plan, is the only way to organize an anarchist society, is the only proper way, or the clearly best way, to live in the absence of hierarchy and domination, like many communist anarchists who I have met, contradictions start to emerge. There is a tension between that sort of rationalistic assurance in your plan, and anarchism itself — it is a mentality more proper to liberal technocrats or socialist bureaucrats than an anarchist, because it requires enforcement, both social and, eventually, physical. Once you cease to recognize social arrangements other than your own pet one as valid non-hierarchical ways to live, you see hierarchy everywhere and lock down the fluidity of social relations. You become like the Marxists, obsessed with static organizations and traditional ways of doing things. We must “operate through the proper channels” and “speak to the council.” And when this end state is achieved, if you become complacent, assured of the impeccability of what exists now, you become deaf to the needs of people, your society becomes elevated over them, the master of their interests instead of the servant. Suddenly they are subjugated to ideas, laws, something exists over their heads.</p>

<p>Thus, the inevitable result of having a revolutionary approach to anarchism is that those who were the most fervent revolutionaries will also become the most fervent reactionaries; after all, if you overthrew the old state of things in the name of a new ideal state, then if that new state is itself threatened, in the eternal shifting tides of human needs and knowledge, one must go back to the grindstone of revolution and prevent the wheel from turning again — if you let it roll past, the revolution was for naught! Thus, because they have a picture in their minds of not just <em>their</em> ideal world, but <em>the</em> ideal world, they must bow to it, serve its rule, and “protect the Revolution!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in comparison, the insurrection of the egoist anarchists wants nothing more than the destruction of all subjugation of the individual to anything whatsoever — no spiritual ruler, whether secular or religious, <em>as well as</em> no earthly one. No sacred ideas. We may speculate about what sort of arrangements we would prefer, or what sorts of arrangements might arise naturally as a result of the abolition of hierarchies and domination, but we must remain open to all the forms of anarchistic organization that can result from the balancing of social forces. The whole point of the insurrection is to free us from service to anything that is supposed to be greater than ourselves by rejecting all arrangements and ideas that do not benefit us. Thus any arrangement would become, not an idea that hangs over our heads like an idol, which exists separate from us and to which we owe obligations, but something which is contingent, only existing as long as we continually perpetuate it with our actions, and thus only persisting as long as it pleases us to perpetuate it through continued reproduction.</p>

<h2 id="the-balance-of-contradictory-forces">The Balance of Contradictory Forces</h2>

<p>If we are not to prescribe particular social relations once the abolition of hierarchy and domination is achieved, what can we say about the nature of such a society?</p>

<p>Let me start by setting the stage a little.</p>

<p>I have always viewed the development of society and its successive states of being as the product of different forces, some contradictory and some aligned, each always changing, pulling it in different directions. There are the forces of individuals themselves, trying to push or pull society and the vast forces around them in directions that suit their needs and interests, but there are also the forces of various collectivities. Yes, these collectivities are composed of individuals, by which they multiply their power, but these collectivities gain more power than merely the sum of the abilities of their members to exert power; moreover, such collectivities, when not strictly subordinated to the whims of their constituent individuals, often take on a life of their own, manifesting their own interests and their own unique internal logic, and therefore introduce their own, new forces to the interplay that shapes society.</p>

<p>You can understand this like Newtonian physics: society, if taken as a whole, is pushed and pulled in various directions by forces that come from things inside of it. Indeed, like a Newtonian physics object, society has its own mass and inertia as well: the larger a society is, the more forces are at play, and so the harder it is to change the direction that the overall sum of forces is sending it in.</p>

<p>Crucially, each collectivity is itself a microcosm of “society as a whole,” with its own internal forces directing it, and any mutually interacting section of society can be marked off and treated as its own society. Thus, “society” is a fractal, and this analysis of forces can be applied at any scale: the corporation is its own small society, which has its own internal forces acting on it, pushing it in various directions, and so does the union, the family, the institution, the state, the nation. Furthermore, as long as we’re not looking at the global grouping of all of human civilization, every society, from a nation all the way down to a friend group, has forces external to it that act on it as well, pushing against its own internal directive forces. Thus, at whatever level we look at, the direction of any collectivity is the result of the cumulative direction of the forces that compose it, modified by the collectivity’s own unique force and internal logic and then set against the sum of the forces around it. Even the direction of an individual is the product of their own singular force and internal logic as weighed against all the other forces at play around them.</p>

<p>Thus the actual direction of any individual, collectivity, or “society” is determined. Likewise, the direction of the forces that individuals and collectivities exert in opposition to the forces around them, their impulse vectors, are determined by the interests of that individual or collectivity. Here, again, collectivities have emergent properties: the interests of an organization may not be aligned with the interests of any of its members, as the organization has its own decision-making procedures and internal logic that its members play out without necessarily knowing or understanding fully what interests that leads the collectivity to have, and certain members may be more interested in the perpetuation of the collectivity itself then actually making it perform any of the functions for which it was formed.</p>

<p>Note also that collectivities are not strictly separate beasts. They can overlap and intersect with one another, as some of the same individuals that compose one also compose the other, or because they share interests or ideas, or influence each other’s internal logic. This complicates the picture, as overlapping collectivities can be thought of as separate entities that compose a new collectivity, or one collectivity, or whatever else, depending on how you want to look at it.</p>

<p>Thus we arrive at a picture where “society,” at every scale at which we look examine such a collection of people and emergent entities, is shaped by the forces of the individuals and collectivities that compose it. These forces and the things that give birth to them can be separate or overlapping, interpenetrating or opposed, contradictory or aligned, competitive or cooperative. The interplay of these forces shapes how society will look, gives birth to other forces, shapes the very landscape of the material world within which all this takes place. Because society is shaped by the interplay of changing <em>forces</em> that each pull in a <em>direction</em>, society can never be stationary for long, it is always moving, always progressing, not subject to any absolute.</p>

<p>If these social forces are unbalanced, if some are unilaterally stronger than others, the interests of the weaker will be crushed beneath the boot heel of the stronger, and society will careen forever in whatever direction the stronger force wishes, not finding equilibrium anywhere, until some new force arrives that is strong enough to restore balance. This is most clearly the case in dictatorships, where the interests of only one man, or only a few, count for the most, and the rest of society is pushed inexorably in the direction he wills until something knocks it off that course — a war, a revolution, a death.</p>

<p>It is not only in the obvious cases that such an imbalance can be seen, though: under capitalism, because a certain class holds the means of production and even the means of subsistence, they have greatly increased power compared to the dispossessed who must now come to them for alms. Because of this imbalance of power, of social forces, the captialist class can exploit workers ruthlessly, only hindered in that aim by the competition of other capitalists, which is often filled with more tacit agreement than real competition. Not only that, though: the capitalist class can also levy its disproportionate power to push against the power of the mightiest collectivity in modern society, the state, and control it, directing its collective force — which, because of its dominance in society, is then multiplied by the collective force of all of society — to protect their property, keep primitive accumulation going, and grant them more power and special privileges with which to grind everyone else beneath their heels.</p>

<h2 id="anarchism-as-balance">Anarchism As Balance</h2>

<p>This kind of imbalance is destructive to the interests, freedom, and autonomy of individuals because it creates power over, which in turn leads to domination, the free play of coercion in the negative sense, and ultimately hierarchy and authority, which are self-reinforcing.</p>
