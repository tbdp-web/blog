<p>So. Society is the outcome of an eternal, ongoing process of push and pull: “social war,” if you will. That doesn’t sound like the theories of social harmony and mutual gain and benefit that anarchists are known for, now does it? In fact, it sounds downright Darwinian, even Malthusian, and certainly a bit, well, Nietzschiean. You’ll be glad to know, however, that this theory is just a theory — it has no normative implications. It doesn’t tell us what we should try to achieve. And in my case, I wish to achieve egalitarianism, equality, mutual benefit — in other words, anarchism. How do we transform this admittedly rather ugly description of society into a practical account of how we get and keep anarchy? That is exactly what I’ll be discussing in this essay.</p>

<h2 id="the-balance-of-social-forces">The Balance of Social Forces</h2>

<p>Since the direction of a society is determined by the forces contained within it, if the forces in society are out of balance, with some forces dominating, that society will inexorably begin moving in the direction those forces dictate, serving the interests of the social entities that predominate in power and subordinating — ultimately erasing completely — the interests of those that do not. The state of society, who it serves, what each of the social entities can achieve and do, will all bend to the power of the dominating forces, whether they want to or not. There may be more or less resistance, but ultimately that resistance will be worn down. This is an elaborated, large scale version of the effects of power-over as opposed to equal power, as I described in “Power and Hierarchy”: when there is an inequality of power, interests are subordinated; when there is equality, they are considered equally.</p>

<p>In societies that have a state, the predominant power in that society is the state itself: through its myths of legitimacy and its use of force to cow and beat and scare its citizens, to create coordination problems for those who would resist it, it wields the might of almost the full population under its rulership. Thus, the state is really composed of two parts: the organization itself, the actual members of the state bureaucracy, and the mass of people which tacitly support it, lending their power to it through their apathy and fear. In a society where the state predominates, the state dictates the parameters of what can happen in society almost exclusively; therefore, whoever can <em>capture</em> the state gets unilateral say in what interests are served and what aren’t. Any attempt to put “checks and balances” on the power of the state is ultimately futile in the long run, however, as long as the state remains a state, because they will have to be <em>components of the state</em> themselves, parts of the same organization, created out of the same people, sharing many of the same interests, and having no truly separate power to wield against the other parts of the state. Ultimately, there is no way to ensure the state represents any interests other than its own, because without something separate from it and equally powerful, there is nothing really to hold it accountable to the promises it makes.</p>

<p>The state can be captured by a myriad of interests — religious nationalists, or liberal progressives, or fascist dictators, or neoliberal capitalist cronies — as the other powers in society dictate, especially in comparison to the power of the state bureaucracy itself, and in each of these cases the arc of society will be forcefully bent in the direction that party chooses until such a time as their power is broken. In a capitalist society, the people most able to truly capture the levers of power are, of course, the rich and powerful, the capitalists. This can be expressed in explicit bargains with the state, beneficial regulations and manipulations of the market, protections of artificial monopolies, but it is also far subtler and far-reaching: even in countries that seem more democratic, the law itself was typically originally created by the rich elites and wealthy landowners, and legitimized to the people through <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/7370/7370-h/7370-h.htm#CHAPTER_V">self-serving myths</a>, for their own mutual protection, making the very foundations of modern liberal legal systems designed to protect the elite classes.</p>

<p>In societies without the state, likewise, different forces can predominate, depending on circumstance and the nature and history of the society and the culture of the people within it. Thus, in the “power vacuums” that are left over after the collapse of states, or in the warzones that nations create fighting each other, we see the back and forth play of other forces: warlords, gangs, foreign powers.</p>

<p>In light of this, the only possible way to create a society which serves the interests of all, which treats all interests equally and is not dominated in its historical arc by some overpowering social entity’s power, is to create a balance of power between all of the different myriad powers in society. Each social entity that has significant power must be balanced by another, and that by another (either by the first one or another one), in all of the different spheres and dimensions in which power can be exerted. The unity-collectivities which defend people must be balanced against each other, as must the economic forces, cultural forces — everything. Any institutions or norms that are established must have, outside of them and equal to them, separate from them, mutually opposing and balancing forces which check their progress. The entirety of society must be a cross-hatched network of mutually opposing forces, all networked together in a loop, all pushing and pulling and balancing each other out, so that no imbalances of power can exist:</p>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Fully-connected_mesh_network.svg/2277px-Fully-connected_mesh_network.svg.png" alt="fully connected mesh network" /></p>

<p>The only way to achieve this is to radically decentralize and distribute power. The power of violence, defense, and enforcement, economic power, social power, any kind of power conceivable, must be decentralized, broken up, opposed to itself, and in doing so distributed to as many different social entities as possible. This is both the necessary precondition and the end state of anarchy, where everyone holds power over everything that effects them equally, everyone is as empowered and enabled as possible. Without that, some predominating power will always crush and destroy any interests that oppose it or don’t concern it.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>To summarize: the instinct to plan out the specific norms and institutions of society is a contradictory, dangerous one. The only proper attitude is one of… lassiez-faire, let’s say — a willingness to let the anarchic encounter play out in all its million forms however it might. But, with that in mind, there are some essential things that we <em>can</em> say about society and the necessary conditions of anarchism; not specific prescriptions of institutions and norms, and so not a social plan, but an analysis of the real, actual, <em>Wertfrei</em> laws of social reality — a social theory.</p>

<p>Although I, like any anarchist, have my pet-favorite norms and institutions — individualist anarchist for sure, with a mixture of communism — and have some idea of which norms are likely to prevail and which not under conditions of equality, and some idea of how such a society must be structured in order to ensure social balance, the most I can really say is that such a balance <em>must</em> be achieved for anarchy to be possible. And that any society without such a balance is doomed to drift off into disaster, dragged inexorably down by its own internal contradictions and imbalances, slowly spinning out of control until the center cannot hold and all hell breaks loose.</p>

<p>This seems to be close to the picture of society that Proudhon himself had in mind. A society not explicitly defined by any particular laws or norms, but instead by conditions of balance, the equality of individuals and collectivities, which, through its own reasoning, experience, learning, and responsiveness to needs, would <em>Progress</em>, continually change and adapt, constructing and destroying norms in different places and times as needed to balance the interests of all. To close with a quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The “anarchism without adjectives” position was a reaction to this kind of doctrinaire model-building, and the resulting conflicts between the proponents of various totalizing blueprints for society… The basic idea was that anarchists should stop feuding over the specific economic model of a future anarchist society, and leave that for people to work out for themselves as they saw fit. Economic ideas like Proudhon’s mutualism, Tucker’s individualist free enterprise and Kropotkin’s communism were complementary, and in a post-state society a hundred flowers would bloom from one locality, one social grouping, to the next…</p>

  <p>Any post-state society will include both individuals and communities adhering to many conflicting ideas of just what “freedom,” “autonomy” and “rights” entail. Whatever “law code” communities operate by will be worked out, not as obvious logical deductions from axioms, but through constant interaction between individuals and groups asserting their different understandings of what rights and freedom entail. And it will be worked out after the fact of such conflicts, through the practical negotiations of the mediating and adjudicating bodies within communities. — Kevin Carson, <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anarchism-w-o-adjectives"><em>Anarchism Without Adjectives</em></a>.</p>
