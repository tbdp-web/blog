&lt;p&gt;Occupancy-and-use is the term given by anarchist theory to a vague collection of property norms focused around the idea that the right&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to use a thing, to determine what happens to it, and determine the conditions of its transfer, etc, should be assigned to those who &lt;em&gt;actually do&lt;/em&gt; use (or occupy, a form of use that has to do with spacial location) that thing. Of course, the range and extent of this bundle of rights, as well as what counts as actual occupancy or use, is up for debate and compromise, but that is simply the nature of anarchism: any too-rigid set of rules will of necessity not be adapted to the particular situations and needs of the people that are to follow them, and so will not rationally and willingly be obeyed by them, instituting another form of subjugation, requiring either force, authority, or indoctrination. No set of rules, not even one that claims to be moral, can be absolute, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tbdp-web.github.io/blog/2021/12/08/egoism.html&quot;&gt;can be placed over the interests of individuals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many arguments as to why occupancy-and-use norms are preferable to others. Against collectivism and communism, occupancy-and-use allows individuals to have a sphere of action within which they have autonomy, independance from others, the ability to do things and live without the need to get the permission, or have the involvement, of anyone else. To quote Proudhon, in this sense, property is “a breastplate of [an individuals’s] personality,” protecting  them from “the incursions of [their] fellows.” Against private property and absenteeism, occupancy-and-use insures that each person actually has what they need to ensure their individuality, their extrication from others, and that no one can assert their dominance over things that are not necessary for them to do this, but which others need for that purpose. It does this by ensuring that those who actually use something, whether for production or for shelter, or for other things, are accorded the right to use it without the need to pay tribute to, or obey the dictats of, any other person. Occupancy and use are important here precisely because actual use is the most important indicator of whose autonomy and individuality it serves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could go into more detail, but I think I have already elaborated on the reasoning behind these two points in enough detail in other places (see: &lt;a href=&quot;https://tbdp-web.github.io/blog/2021/10/27/reciprocity.html&quot;&gt;‘Two Principles of Anarchism’&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tbdp-web.github.io/blog/2021/12/09/not-ancap.html&quot;&gt;‘Why I Am No Longer an Anarcho-Capitalist’&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://tbdp-web.github.io/blog/2021/12/19/relations.html&quot;&gt;‘Anarchistic Relations’&lt;/a&gt;). In this article I want to elaborate on a point that I have used concerning worker cooperatives, but which I think can be used more precisely, and with even more effect, in the context of distributing ownership to individuals. This has to do with the Hayekian conception of tacit, or distributed, knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Hayek, the market is superior to a centralized, planned economy, because it allows each person to make use of the specific knowledge they have about their situation and the particular materials they have to work with in order to move production forward. By distributing the information processing between people, and letting people with the best knowledge of each particular situation take charge of that situation, the market can use more knowledge, and make &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; use of it, than a central planner could. After all, even if all that tacit, local, distributed knowledge &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; even be communicated to a central authority, it would be quickly overwhelemed by the sheer volume of information, let alone the task of coming up with the huge volumes of complex comands it would have to distribute out to all points of the economy. To quote from &lt;em&gt;The Use of Knowledge in Society&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The peculiar character of the problem of a rational economic order is  determined precisely by the fact that the knowledge of the circumstances of which we must make use never exists in concentrated or integrated  form but solely as the dispersed bits of incomplete and frequently  contradictory knowledge which all the separate individuals possess. The  economic problem of society is thus not merely a problem of how to  allocate “given” resources—if “given” is taken to mean given to a single mind which deliberately solves the problem set by these “data.” It is  rather a problem of how to secure the best use of resources known to any of the members of society, for ends whose relative importance only  these individuals know. Or, to put it briefly, it is a problem of the  utilization of knowledge which is not given to anyone in its totality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, however, notice that the strength of this argument hinges on the people who are actually using and producing things — means of production, materials, etc — getting to decide what to do with the things they have, and communicating through the price system so that the relevant bits of their local knowledge are incapsulated and communicated instantly to others, who are motivated &lt;em&gt;by&lt;/em&gt; the price system to change their actions. Nowhere in this does the capitalist, or the landlord, come in! The capitalist is not using their capital, and often knows little about the specifics of how it is applied. They are not the ones actually on the ground directing the use of the property used in production, with local, tacit, distributed knowledge about things relevant to that. They just obtain rent in return for &lt;em&gt;letting&lt;/em&gt; other people do all that. To quote again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If we can agree that the economic problem of society is mainly one of  rapid adaptation to changes in the particular circumstances of time and  place, it would seem to follow that the ultimate decisions must be left  to the people who are familiar with these circumstances, who know  directly of the relevant changes and of the resources immediately  available to meet them. We cannot expect that this problem will be  solved by first communicating all this knowledge to a central board  which, after integrating &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; knowledge, issues its orders. We must solve it by some form of decentralization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This criticism of “central boards” also applies to the boards of corporations, capitalists or groups of capitalists, etc. The fact that they do not have to integrate &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; knowledge does not mean that they are aware of the knowledge relevant to the use of the property they lay claim to, or could integrate all of that knowledge and use it effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course decentralization — or, as I prefer it, &lt;em&gt;distribution&lt;/em&gt; — is just one piece of the puzzle: “the ‘man on the spot’ cannot decide solely on the basis of his limited  but intimate knowledge of the facts of his immediate surroundings.” There needs to be a way to communicate encapsulated distributed information in a way that allows people with local knowledge to gain just enough information to act in light of the local knowledge of others, without actually &lt;em&gt;having&lt;/em&gt; that local knowledge. This is what the price system is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is in this connection that what I have called the  “economic calculus” proper helps us, at least by analogy, to see how  this problem can be solved, and in fact is being solved, by the price  system. Even the single controlling mind, in possession of all the data for some small, self-contained economic system, would not—every time some small adjustment in the allocation of resources had to be made—go explicitly through all the relations between ends and means which might possibly be affected. It is indeed the great contribution of the pure logic of choice that it has demonstrated conclusively that even such a single mind could solve this kind of problem only by constructing and constantly using rates of equivalence (or “values,” or “marginal rates of substitution”), &lt;em&gt;i.e.,&lt;/em&gt; by attaching to each kind of scarce resource a numerical index which cannot be derived from any property possessed by that particular thing, but which reflects, or in which is condensed, its significance in view of the whole means-end structure. In any small change he will have to consider only these quantitative indices (or “values”) in which all the relevant information is concentrated; and, by adjusting the quantities one by one, he can appropriately rearrange his dispositions without having to solve the whole puzzle &lt;em&gt;ab initio&lt;/em&gt; or without needing at any stage to survey it at once in all its ramifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, &lt;em&gt;prices&lt;/em&gt; represent an encapsulated quantitative representation of the relation between means and ends, values, of the entire market. As such, they can be used to calculate the best use of things. Here, again, all that is required for the price system to work is a single price, at the point of sale; economic rent (ongoing, recurring, indefinate prices on things) is of no help to this. In fact, because it is indefinate, economic rent might actually be a hindrance to relating all the values of the individuals in a market together, since it might make some values appear infinate, introducing a sort of singularity into the calculation. This, again, is an argument for only allowing prices &lt;em&gt;at the point of sale&lt;/em&gt;, when use transfers from one person to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s another fun point: economic rents encourage the separation of means and ends in the price system by inflating the cost of means relative to their actual cost in terms of alternate ends given up. After all, for the price system to work as it is “intended,” the price of means must come down to labor and scarcity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the one hand, people ask for payment for things because they want to be compensated for their labor time. This is for two reasons: payment for labor time is a compensation for not doing other possibly profitable things that could have been done with that time, and it is compensation for the inherent disutility of labor (it being unpleasant). Therefore, the price of a means partially represents the ends that could have been served if a different means had been made in the first place, or even none at all.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the smaller the amount of something there is, the more reluctant people are to give it up, because they have more important uses to put it to still than if it was more plentiful. In weighing the use of means for different ends, then, the price of the means partially represents the other ends the means could have applied to.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic rent makes that first signal artificially high, because instead of being a finite compensation for a finite amount of labor, it is an amortized, ongoing cost, not proportional at all. Economic rent also distorts the second signal involved in pricing means, because it makes things seem artificially scarce: if people aren’t calculating the price of something based on whether they actually need to keep it to use it, which is how their subjective ends get factored into scarcity cost, that messes with things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, there are good market-oriented, subjectivist, pragmatic reasons that occupancy-and-use should be seriously considered.&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found out I was a few months ago. Since then, a lot of things have started to make a lot more sense than I did, and I’ve been happier with myself, and who I am, than ever before. I’ve been taking quick strides towards becoming the woman I want to be, too, and it’s been exhilerating, if also a little frightening. As I’ve gone through the process of learning what it means to be trans, and interacting with the community more, some of the things I said in my previous article on transgender people, back in September, are starting to look wrong. Or at least, incomplete. With my new perspective, I think it’s time to go back and revise some of the things I said. Most of the research I did was good, and I still stand by it, but a lot of the stuff around it requires some revisiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-science-and-trans-people&quot;&gt;2. Science and Trans People&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that I would like to say is that medicalization of genderqueer people is not really a good thing. Although the neurological and other studies can be helpful, the important thing to remember is that because gender is a phenomenological experience, until we are capable of mapping the brain out and inspecting its contents with enough fidelity to figure out &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; inherent traits of personality and identity — which I highly doubt it will ever be possible to do thanks to the inherent complexity and black-box nature of neural networks — attempting to decide gender based on brain scans is only marginally better than phrenology. Additionally, the gendered characteristics of the brain that we are even capable of looking at fall into a bimodal distribution even for cis people: some cis women’s brains fall within the range more commonly associated with male brains, etc, meaning that it would be totally possible for a trans woman to &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; have a brain that looks more like a cis man’s. It’s all about probabilities, and probabilities admit of exceptions — exceptions that are often more common than you’d expect, and deserve respect and concern. Furthermore, since being transgender is a psychological thing, medicalization is just a concern in general. Excessive medicalization of other mental illnesses is also a problem; while psychiatry does help, it is best if it is encapsulated in more holistic methods, and I think this is true for being transgender as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should also add that my focus on binary trans people in the previous article was unfortunate, and not even warranted by the studies I was using, which, being bimodal and probabalistic in nature, make the existence of brains which exist at a neutral point in the binary, or even outside of it entirely, a complete possibility. Leaving aside those studies for the reasons I mentiond, just as feeling that you are another gender than the one you were assigned at birth is valid if you pick the opposite gender, or a gender that already exists, I really don’t see why there would be any reason why new genders can’t exist either. After all, gender (I’ll get to this later), exists on thousands of nuanced dimensions, and the two particular instances we have now aren’t even really “real,” just what we happened to arrive at, and they’ve been different throughout history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, I don’t think an excessive scientific study of trans people is particularly helpful to begin with. Because psychological/phenomenological phenomena are necessarily not repeatable or inspectiable, not things you can break down, dissasemble, study, and reproduce, non-social science will never really be able to capture it. To attempt to do so, scientists would have to create imperfect proxies that &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; testable and repeatable and so on, and that then leads to the danger of treating those not as &lt;em&gt;indications&lt;/em&gt; of being trans, but instead as &lt;em&gt;definitions&lt;/em&gt; of being trans, especially with the tendency of people to quote and use science they don’t really understand for their own purposes. This is why I actually think that any kind of neurological or physical study of why people are transgender &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; wait until social sciences, psychology, and trans care are much more mature, and society has accepted us more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-gender-gender-roles-gender-expression-and-gender-identity&quot;&gt;3. Gender, Gender Roles, Gender Expression, and Gender Identity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gender appears to be a social construct: a collection of roles (usually two, but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; always) that are developed through historical and socio-cultural forces, and then assigned to people. These roles include ideas about how you should act, what social roles you should fulfill and how you should do so, how you should relate to others, how you should dress, even how you should think. Crucially, no one property determines gender; everything exists on a sliding scale and for every categorization that can be arrived at there are clear and widely-agreed-upon exceptions, both in the relation between sex and gender, and in the designation of what gender someone is. Thus it is best to define gender in terms of a set of properties that can be more or less satisfied, and which in total &lt;em&gt;add up&lt;/em&gt; to something closer or farther away from a definition, instead of a rigid set of properties all things of one gender must share. (This is actually true of all definitions, in my opinion, as I am not a fan of any kind of essentialism). In essence, then, gender is really a high-dimensional latent space, and gender &lt;em&gt;roles&lt;/em&gt; are the specific areas in that space that society deems “standard” or “normal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These “gender roles” appear to have varied extremely widely throughout history, which indicates that they are not biologically determined. Nevertheless, people are drawn to each role as it most naturally fits them, in the way that people are often drawn to other things they have innate talents in or affinities for, which are also biological determined (sue me, I’m a physicalist). Generally, the biological sex of a person effects their minds and therefore their personalities, and makes a certain point in the space of latent gender space work for them. This is what we call “gender identity:” the desire to exist at some point of the gender latent space. Basically, gender roles are at least partially constructed based on the two most frequent points on the bimodal distribution of gender identities (which is based on the bimodal distribution of biological sex traits for the mind), and since biological sex traits for the body tend to correlate strongly with those of the mind, those are associated with those roles as well, and used to guess someone’s gender identity. The fact that there are only two gender roles, it should be stressed, is due to an imperfect reification of the bimodal nature of biological sex differences, not to anything inherent. Just like if we made two rigid roles in any other area of society people would reluctantly sort themselves into them, if we allowed more gender roles it would better map onto what worked for people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biological sex itself is a very complicated thing, however, and people are capable having mixes of the characteristics manifesting in different areas. Thus, isible, external, physiological sex traits do not correlate perfectly with the internal ones that lead to gender identity. Therefore, for every sex characteristic that “every” member of the gender roles has, you can find a well-documented exception. For instance, there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/swyer-syndrome/&quot;&gt;cis women with XY chromosomes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/gynecomastia&quot;&gt;cis men with breasts&lt;/a&gt;, the list goes on. One example of this is trans people: people for who the biological sex determiners that are externally visible would normally be correlated with a personality that would be suited for one gender role, but the mind developed in such a way that it was actually suited for a different point in the space of genders. Since bodily sex characteristics are typically (absent this malfunction) correlated with gender identity, the brain structure expects accompanying traits, but doesn’t find them. Hence, typically speaking, trans people will experience various states of distress that their bodies aren’t as they would be to ideally align with their minds. Also, because their minds are oriented toward a particular point in gender space, they’ll typically experience great satisfaction and happiness from getting closer to that. And because gender is stretchy and fluid already, it is certainly possible for someone with a certain gender identity to fully embody their desired gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, however, a lot of gender has to do with how someone things, acts, and interacts with others, and those can be satisfied by gender identity directly; insofar as people don’t act in line with the gender associated with their identity, it is usually because they are being forced not to, and so it is a game or lie. Just as a woman pretending to be a man is still acting/thinking/etc like a woman, just simulating doing it like a man, or vice versa (for any pair of genders you like), the same is true for trans people even if they don’t “act” their gender. In this way, a lot of the most important components of someone’s gender is already determined by someone’s gender identity. In fact, part of being a certain gender is wanting to be that gender and achieve it, and gender identity satisfies this property as well. Hence the “wanting to be an X is a symptom of being X”, where X is a gender, saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed it could be argued that the most important part of any gender is the mental, social, psychological part, and the rest (presentation, etc) is just icing on the cake; in that sense, someone who has a gender identity is pretty much already entirely that gender. And since everyone already satisfies a certain gender role “more or less” and not completely, someone is not really that much less of a certain gender just because it’s only an identity so far and they haven’t been able to express it much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll add that there is a lot more here I could talk about, especially about how gender roles are formed, but I feel like the whole analysis would get totally out of hand. To summarize:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender&lt;/strong&gt; is a high-dimensional latent space, where different properties relevant to gender are mapped onto different axes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mental traits are the most important dimensions in determining gender, because other traits (physical, social) have so many exceptions and are so vague and complex. For further illustration of why mental traits are the most important, try to think about what is actually the most important about the different genders. Is a man really reducable to his penis? A woman her uturus? Hardly. Furthermore, to take an extreme case, note that when, for instance, in comics, someone’s brain is taken out and put in a robot body, they might mope about not having the physical characteristics of their gender anymore, but they still get referred to with the pronouns of their gender and still pretty much think of themselves as that gender and act that way. It therefore makes sense to think of people, &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; personality, not just &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; body, as being gendered, and of course what determines what you are as a person (other identities and traits that pertain to your personhood) is what is in your mind — e.g. in this case, gender identity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Biological sex is very complex, and can be inconsistent or completely non-binary throughout the body, including the brain.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The way the brain developes based on biological sex determines personality, which determines which point in the gender latent space people function best in. This is &lt;strong&gt;gender identity.&lt;/strong&gt; This is usually aligned with the biological sex of the rest of the body, but not always. Sometimes particular things are off, sometimes it’s a brain/body split, sometimes it’s a chromosomes/everythign else split, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Because the way biological sex effects the development and the way normal distributions work, the distribution in gender space of gender identities is bimodal. Because of this, societies tend to pick two points in the gender space that relatively satisfy one of the the two most common points in the distribution of gender identities more (that picking is determined by many factors). These become reified as &lt;strong&gt;gender roles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The external manifestations of biological sex are also bimodal, and mostly correlate with &lt;strong&gt;gender identity&lt;/strong&gt;, but because biological sex can be inconsistent this is not always the case. However, because these two usually correlate, societies use external manifestations to assume gender identity, and thereby assign gender roles, and this &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; works (unless the gender roles are not actually very well mapped onto even the bimodal distribution, which is often the case, and how you get sexism, etc). In cases where the assigned role is completely different than the identity, someone is &lt;strong&gt;transgender&lt;/strong&gt;. This can be because a different already-existing role works for them, or because they want to be on a completely different point in the gender space.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Someone can be closer to or farther away from a certain point in gender space (a gender role) on a lot of different axes, and because of the amount of exceptions and complexity of gender, it is possible to move where you are on that space by changing expression, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Additionally, since the most important axes in gender space are already mental/psychological,[^1] and gender identity is a mental/psychological phenomena that basically determines the gender of the mind, having a certian gender identity basically gets you most of the way to being a certain gender even without changes in expression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, no, trans people aren’t “crazy.” We’re aware, all too aware, that we don’t satisfy the physical characteristics of our desired gender role, of what our biological sex is, etc, we’re not claiming counterfactuals. We are voicing the fact that a different gender role than the one we’ve been assigned would be far better for us (we’d be more functional and happier), and that it’s possible to adopt a gender because physical characteristics don’t just simply map onto a gender binary and definitions aren’t essentialist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-neopronouns-and-xenogenders&quot;&gt;4. Neopronouns and Xenogenders&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that all of this analysis is completely agnostic to how many genders there are, what they are, what constitutes them, etc. In fact, I’m totally happy to invent new genders, as long as they actually correlate somewhat to a gender identity and the axes that gender space has. This is why I’m more than happy to accept non-binary people, xenogender stuff, etc. And since pronouns are just a shorthand way of referring back to someone based on their gender (to allow for increased reference capacity), having as many pronouns as their are relatively standardized gender roles makes total sense to me, so neopronouns are really cool.

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://tbdp-web.github.io/blog/2021/12/09/not-ancap.html&quot;&gt;giving up&lt;/a&gt; the anarcho-capitalist framework for distinguishing between legitimate and illegitimate interactions between people, I gave up clarity for greater correctness. This has left my philosophical system, in terms of what I support and do not support, in a state of general flux. This was acceptable, in the sense that being correct is far more important than being simple and comprehensible — there are a million wrong, but quite simple, narratives about the world which everyone rejects on these grounds — but nevertheless establishing some clarity at some point is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My previous attempt at this, ‘Two Principles of Anarchism,’ was a good start, but there were a few things wrong with it. To begin with, it analyzed desirable relations from the perspective of the individual, in a roughly first-person way: what any individual would have a reason to respect in another, and what they would not have a reason to respect (the new sense of legitimate and illegitimate in a non-cognitivist moral framework). This is all well and good when it is framed as an ethical treatise, but the new perspective required to re-formulate my views as a political philosophy require a translation from the first person perspective to the third person, and that requires a new philosophical analysis. Additionally, the analysis in ‘Two Principles’ was purposefully vague, leaving many of the specific implications of what legitimate relations between people would look like up for interpretation on the part of the reader. This, also, was good for the project I was attempting to do, but I nevertheless thing that there are specifics that need filling in even so. Moreover, the beginnings of the theory of ‘just price’ that I hinted at in that essay require actual elaboration, and I think in doing so, as well as integrating and clarifying my opinions on consent, a third-person picture of legitimate relations might be arrived at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This essay will be an exploratory attempt at this project, attempting to make clearer the guiding principle that differentiates between legitimate and illegitimate, desirable and undesirable (for me), relations. I will attempt to, incompletely, cover the topic from several different angles, analyze the implications of each angle, and, perhaps, in that dialectic, get closer to a clarification of everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The autonomy of individuals exists in a multitude of overlapping spheres. Many exercises of an individual’s autonomy do not interfere with that of others, such as purely elective and voluntrary interactions, or exercise of control over one’s own person and possessions in a way that doesn’t interfere with anyone else’s, especially when someone doesn’t have need of your possessions. On the other hand, many exercises of autonomy do actually interfere with the autonomy of others: leveraging bargaining power to gain control over people, using violence against them, or exercising control over things that other people are actually using or need to use, in order to gain control over them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each individual has interests, and in order to protect their ability to achieve those interests, as well as to protect their independence and many other important values, each individual has an interest in asserting their maximum autonomy. For instance, strictly speaking, it would be in my interest to be able to take whatever I wanted from anyone else, without reprecussions. That means that the fullest extent of any person’s autonomy is largely incompatible with any (stable) autonomy at all on the part of anyone else. Of course, each other individual has an incentive to assert their own autonomy to its fullest extent in the same manner and for the same reasons, so it would seem that we are at a permanent impasse, a war of all against all, as Hobbes put it: “the state of men [sic] without civil society (which state we may properly call the state of nature) is nothing else but a mere war of all against all; and in that war all men [sic] have equal right unto all things.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way to resolve this, of course, is through reciprocity, the foundation of society, community, and civilization itself. By agreeing to respect some boundary around the autonomy of others, each individual gives up the ability to push the expression of their autonomy to its fullest extent, but in doing so, gains, through the similar commitment of others, security and freedom of movement within their own boundaries. Thus, safe spheres of action, centered around those non-overlapping parts of each person’s autonomy, form. This is something that might be viewed in gift economy terms (much like Wilbur’s gift economy of property idea). We each respect the autonomy of others, by not exercising ours in ways that contradicts or contracts theirs, freely and without expectation of direct reward, but in the general expectation that similar consideration, if not precisely equal in magnitude at least equal in recognition, will be granted to us. To quote Proudhon concerning why this kind of reciprocal gift of autonomy must recognize some equality between people:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But I wish that this consent, of which so much is made, had been given,  either tacitly or formally. What would have been the result? Evidently,  the surrenders would have been reciprocal; no right would have been  abandoned without the receipt of an equivalent in exchange. We thus come back to equality again, — the &lt;em&gt;sine qua non&lt;/em&gt; of appropriation;  so that, after having justified property by universal consent, that is,  by equality, we are obliged to justify the inequality of conditions by  property. Never shall we extricate ourselves from this dilemma. Indeed,  if, in the terms of the social compact, property has equality for its  condition, at the moment when equality ceases to exist, the compact is  broken and all property becomes usurpation. We gain nothing, then, by  this pretended consent of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what characterizes interactions that I, as an anarchist who primarily values individual autonomy, value most: interactions in which there is mutual, reciprocal respect for the autonomy of both parties, through either non-interference, or through the representation of both party’s interests in the interactions that take place between them. After all, you only respect someone’s autonomy to the degree that you ensure that your interactions with them are also serving their goals, not just yours; to the extent that you, to quote Kant,  “[a]ct in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any attempt to extend the use of one’s autonomy beyond the borders of another’s is a violation of this order, and as such, no one else has any reason besides the threat of violence itself to respect that overstep: if they are to respect your autonomy while you do not respect theirs, they directly lose autonomy twice over. First, the autonomy lost in not exercising theirs where it overlaps yours, and second, in the autonomy lost by respecting your ability to overtake their autonomy where yours overlaps theirs. There is not anything symmetrical to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the sphere of a person’s autonomy which does or does not effect others can expand and contract. Each person respects the boundaries of others in order to ensure for themselves boundaries around their autonomy, but sometimes respecting the boundaries of others would leave someone with very little, or no, sphere of autonomy for their own, no boundaries to set, and that means that there is no incentive for them to respect the boundaries of others &lt;em&gt;until such a time as they have boundaries for themselves.&lt;/em&gt; Thus, a sort of Lockean proviso comes into play: unless others have enough (and perhaps as good, who knows) to ensure that they, too, have a place to live to call their own, enough to eat, enough to drink, some way to provide for themselves that they have control over, one’s own possessions are forfeit, as they have no claim to be respected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, whenever you see relations where someone who has all the cards, so to speak, dictates to others what they can and can’t do, based on the fact that they have nothing apart from the whims of the person who temporarily grants them things, you see violence, because the only reason those people could have to not simply seize what they need is that they are under threat. Otherwise, an attempted invasion of, or prevention of, autonomy, would be met with indifference (being ignored) or resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, if you see any interaction between people in which their interests are not given equal consideration, then there is some kind of violence, or the threat of it, or indoctrination, in play. Otherwise, each side, recognizing that they are no more inherently lesser than any other, would assert their own interests as strenuously as the others, and the natural balance between equal forces is a point at an equal distance between them. To quote Proudhon (from &lt;em&gt;What Is Property?&lt;/em&gt;): “Whoever says commerce, says exchange of equal values; for, if the  values are not equal, and the injured party perceives it, he will not  consent to the exchange, and there will be no commerce.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it is impossible to strictly and absolutely describe the boundaries that the balancing of interests might lead to between people, I think a good start might be some sort of occupany-and-use norm for property. There are several reasons for this. First of all, the primary importance that material things represent for the preservation of the autonomy of individuals is, first, providing them some use in the maintinence of their lives, and, second, affording them some space, separate from others, that they can rely on, in order to protect their individuality. To quote Proudhon again, from &lt;em&gt;Theory of Property&lt;/em&gt; this time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Property is not measured by merit, as it is neither wages, nor reward,  nor decoration, nor honorific title; it is not measured by the power of  the individual, since labor, production, credit and exchange do not  require it at all. It is a free gift, accorded to man, with a view to  protecting him against the attacks of poverty and the incursions of his  fellows. It is the breastplate of his personality and equality,  independent of differences in talent, genius, strength, industry, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A gift from who? From his fellow men, of course, in them freely choosing to respect it, so that they might likewise be granted that gift. And something which can serve to fulfill someone’s basic needs (to protect them from poverty) is something that they will actively, fairly regularly be &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; in some way. Likewise, the sphere of things that actually matter for providing a free sphere of action for an individual, not dependent on the approval or acceptance of others, are the sphere of things that they actually occupy (for homes) or use (for their sustenance, through production). Anything that a person does not use, but instead merely rents or lends out to others, is not important for preserving the core boundaries of their autonomy, because they are already not really using it for anything (use is an extension of autonomy). It is merely a luxury in order to extend autonomy further, and when that overlaps with other people’s autonomy (as it does in the case of capital or rental apartments, but might not in the case of rental golf clubs or something), it loses its force except through violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next task, then, is to understand what this violence is. Herein lies a new problem: in the foregoing discussion, I said that whenever you have an interaction in which there is not mutual consideration of the interests of others, there is some kind of violence behind it. However, in a sense, there is some kind of violence behind even the mutual consideration of autonomy or possession that I described. After all, the reason each side in the relation of reciprocal recognition recognizes the other is that they wish to encourage the other side to respect their autonomy, i.e., to not use violence against them to prevent them from doing things, at least within a certain sphere. Thus there is, in a sense, a sort of symmetrical structure to both interactions: person A does what person B wants, &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; equal consideration for their own interests, because if they do not, person B will not consider their interests at all; person A does what person B wants, &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; equal consideration for their own interests, because if they do not, person B will not consider their interests at all. This presents an analytical problem: there is a clear difference between the situations, but there is not (yet) a clear cause that leads to that distinction. In other words, this distinction is not problematic to identify &lt;em&gt;ex post&lt;/em&gt;, because one person’s interests are subordinated to the other and there is not a mutually equitable consideration of them, but &lt;em&gt;ex ante&lt;/em&gt; the analysis is more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the origin of the term ‘anarchism’ comes into play. For me, there are two sides to the word, as I use it to describe myself. There is the positive side, where each party to an interaction is treated equally, their interests on a level playing field instead of subordinated one to the other, and their autonomy respected in as expansive terms as possible without overwhelming anyone else’s; but there is also the negative side. The negative side is encapsulated in my opposition to &lt;strong&gt;ἀρχός&lt;/strong&gt; — rulers, leaders, or princes. No masters, no priests, and no kings. Thus, in order to completely understand my anarchism, one must understand what rulers &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;, because just as the positive side of anarchism defines the &lt;em&gt;ex post&lt;/em&gt; distinction between desirable and undesirable relations, the negative side of the word defines the &lt;em&gt;ex ante&lt;/em&gt; preconditions for those undesirable relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core of what makes rulers is subordination. Subordination is exactly what it sounds like: the placing of one person’s interests on a lower level than someone else’s, treating their interests as secondary, or even irrelevant, in the face of the interests of others. Subordination is not a binary thing: there can be more or less subordination according to the specifics of the relations between individuals. The point is that, if one individual’s interests matter more in a relationship than another’s, some amount of subordination is taking place. Subordination is made possible by differences in bargaining power. If one side is stronger than another side, to that degree they can enforce their will unilaterally on the other side. Likewise, if one side’s autonomy is restricted through desperation or overriding need, or lack of options, that, too, can lead to a difference in bargaining power that can lead to subordination. Let me examine these two origins for subordination in turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first origin of subordination is, comparatively at least, pretty simple. Violence &lt;em&gt;simpliciter&lt;/em&gt; is the use of physical force on a person, or threats thereof.  There are two kinds of violence: initiatory and retaliatory violence, although the distinction between those two is itself complex and multifaceted. I will attempt to sketch out the some of the differences between the two that are clearest to me, but please be aware, again, that that description is incomplete, and also that reality is complex, and every principle admits of an exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initiatory violence is violence that is an attempt to cow or beat someone into subordination, to remove their ability to assert their interests from the equation as something you need to care about. It is about a unilateral restriction of someone’s autonomy that has no care or concern for them or their welfare. In a sense, then, it is the most direct institution of subordination. This can be done through murder, for instance, taking a person out of the question completely, or the threat of murder. It can also be done through theft, robbery, and other things of the sort. Crucially, initiatory violence is used not in response to a restriction of autonomy that was not agreed to prior, but simply at the whim of the person who engages in it. ‘Initiatory’ is perhaps the wrong word for this, though, because initiatory violence doesn’t have to be &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; first to be what it is, it just needs to be threatened first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Existing as a counterpoint to this, ‘retaliatory’ violence is violence that is about asserting one’s interests in the face of existing subordination, generated by existing violence. Thus, if someone is restricting my autonomy, and it was not me that restricted theirs first, the violence I use in response, to assert my interests and prevent them from unilaterally tramping right over me, is retaliatory violence. Retaliatory violence is the violence used by those who are already disadvantaged, in response to oppression, to gain the attention of, and hopefully the fear of, the oppressors, in an attempt to make sure their interests are less subordinated, or not subordinated at all. In a sense, “if you are not going to respect my autonomy, why should I respect yours?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems, then, like the key difference between these two kinds of violence is contained in the fact that, in one case, it is violence that is used to project one person’s autonomy into the sphere where it overlaps with, and suppresses, the autonomy of another person. This can be in the simplest kind of overlap, where the exercise of the autonomy that is being restricted would otherwise have no influence at all on the person who is projecting their power through initiatory violence, or a more complex kind, where the exercise of the suppressed autonomy would actually have suppressed, to some degree, the autonomy of the person suppressing it, but would have simply balanced the interests of the two parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all comes back to the balance of interests in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hierarchy is an exercise of subordination that is ongoing, and is especially present when the subordination in question involves one person controlling the actions of another, not just unilaterally curtailing their autonomy and treating their interests as lesser in general. Thus, for instance, it is subordination when I take what I want from someone else that I don’t need to safeguard my autonomy, and it is hierarchy when I force people to do what I want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authority is the social legitimization of hierarchy. One person controls the actions of another, subordinating their plans, desires, and choices to their own, and this is backed up by socio-cultural beliefs that depict this relation as good, or inescapable, or some combination of the two. Usually, this involves not just the two parties (subordinate and subordinator) but third parties as well, which legitimize the relation by not interfering with it or even joining in reinforcing it. Anarchists recognize all authority as illegitimate and based on lies because no philosophical argument has yet been found for the justice of forcing one person to submit to another, of any submission of one person to another in any other way that fluid, voluntary, and at-will, in fact. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tbdp-web.github.io/blog/2021/12/08/egoism.html&quot;&gt;Nor do I think such a justification can be found.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, then, proper relations between individuals are those in which their interests are represented roughly equally, their autonomous decisions equally respected and their interests and desires all benefiting equally from the exchange. If, in a relation or interaction, one side gets to assert their interests and autonomy without consideration for the other, with no guarantee for the other of their side, then there is subordination in play. Thus the assertions of absentee property of the rich in the face of hunger and homelessness are illegitimate, as they make these assertions with concern only for their own interests, and the response of the people in taking away resources from the rich through direct action is allowable, because it is a balancing of the interests in the relation, an assertion of the value of their autonomy. On the other hand, if someone who already has a home, and food, and tools with which to produce, and so on, steals from one who likewise has those things and not significantly more, in the previous relation both had their autonomy and interests represented, whereas now, the interests of one neighbor are being put over the interests of another, and resistance to this, to ensure that interests are once again asserted on both sides, might be in order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sense, then, only conditions of pure equality can be totally anarchistic and purely reciprocal, as then the interests of all are represented on a totally level playing field, and what I grant to you (the exclusive use of your possessions) is granted completely equally in quantity as well as quality back to me. Nevertheless, equity in quality (that qualitative relation between person and object being the principle of possession, as that is the most direct expression of autonomy) is the most important starting point, and as true equality, enforced by neighbors, would require violating autonomy significantly in an unequal way, I don’t see absolute equality as necessary or particularly desirable. As long as everyone has &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; to provide for the basic requirements of their independence and their basic needs, and any differences in possessions are a result of an exercise in autonomy that does not restrict that of others, each relation between people recognizes their autonomy as of equal importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In truly anarchistic relations, therefore, I hypothesize that there will be equality in autonomy in this sense: that everyone will have the possessions they require to exercise all the crucial facets of individual autonomy and independence, whether or not they can all exercise them to the same degree, and that in order to determine whether something is required for the expression of someone’s individual autonomy, it will be crucially (but not solely) determined by actual occupancy or use. Each person will be willing to grant the greater autonomy of others, as long as they have autonomy in all the important facets themselves, so that granting others greater autonomy in all those facets protects their own sphere; but no one would be willing to protect the autonomy of someone in all the basic facets and more, if they do not have their basic needs met yet.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alexis</name></author><category term="anarchism" /><category term="ethics" /><category term="politics" /><category term="mutualism" /><summary type="html">Introduction</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Why I Am No Longer An Anarcho-Capitalist</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2021/12/09/not-ancap.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why I Am No Longer An Anarcho-Capitalist" /><published>2021-12-09T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2021-12-09T00:00:00-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2021/12/09/not-ancap</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2021/12/09/not-ancap.html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-a-fundamental-confusion-of-values&quot;&gt;1. A Fundamental Confusion Of Values&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My primary problem with anarcho-capitalists, as I mentioned in another essay (‘Two Principles of Anarchism’) is that they are fundamentally confused about values. The value at the heart of all libertarian movements is autonomy, often referred to as liberty: the desire to be a free individual, making one’s own choices about one’s life, labor, and associations, according to one’s own plans. This is &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; people are attracted to any form of libertarianism or individualist anarchism. We want to be free to live our lives how we see fit, and we want other people free to do likewise, because when people are free to find the best solutions to their problems, things are generally better for everyone. This is borne out in the philosophies of countless right-libertarians, from Ayn Rand, to Mises, to Rothbard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that right-libertarians, and especially anarcho-capitalists, notice that one of the things that best guarantees one’s autonomy is property, and so they elevate &lt;em&gt;property&lt;/em&gt; to the top of their hierarchy &lt;em&gt;in place&lt;/em&gt; of autonomy itself. They are right that property is important, because without a sphere over which one has control, without the ability to own the tools needed to produce with one’s labor, without ownership over the &lt;em&gt;product&lt;/em&gt; of one’s own labor, it is indeed extremely difficult to be free. However, they essentially take something that is crucial for autonomy, and maps onto it in some situations, and try to make it replace autonomy entirely, not realizing that &lt;em&gt;the map is not the territory&lt;/em&gt;. Property may be liberty, but it only protects &lt;em&gt;part&lt;/em&gt; of the autonomy that libertarians value. Property is also theft: the ownership of property and enforcement of the rights thereto can be just as oppressive as a system of state or collective ownership of all property; after all, if property defines the limits of one’s autonomy, then one’s autonomy expands and contracts along with how much property one has. If someone else owns the tools you need to work and the property where you live, than you are at their mercy, and your time, associations, and the products of your labor are not your own. You are just at much at their mercy as at the mercy of a communist state! This is hinted at in the logic even of anarcho-capitalists themselves, even though they don’t realize it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The basic flaw in the liberal separation of “human rights” and  “property  rights”  is  that  people  are  treated  as  ethereal abstractions.  If  a  man  has  the  right  to  self-ownership,  to  the control of his life, then in the real world he must also have the right  to  sustain  his  life  by  grappling  with  and  transforming resources; he must be able to own the ground and the resources on which he stands and which he must use. In short, to  sustain  his  “human  right”—or  his  property  rights  in  his own  person—he  must  also  have  the  property  right  in  the material  world,  in  the  objects  which  he  produces.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:ancap5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:ancap5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounds like a right to own the means of production and land under any circumstances, does it not? This does not sound like an argument for individuals to be satisfied with somebody &lt;em&gt;else&lt;/em&gt; owning the tools and machines they use to produce with their labor, and the ground they stand (and live) on; after all, ownership of those things is what would allow them to exercise their individual autonomy. Why should they not seize it, if nobody else is using it for that purpose? That would not even undercut their own claim to property they use for such a purpose. This is also an argument for why absentee ownership does not benefit individual autonomy much, if at all: after all, it is not necessary for the life, or physical ability to stand somewhere to exercise one’s freedom of speech and association, or to produce with one’s own labor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right-libertarians, especially ancaps, try to obfuscate this fact by defining autonomy/liberty &lt;em&gt;in terms&lt;/em&gt; of property, so that it becomes a meaningless statement to say that someone’s property rights are not being violated, but yet they are unfree. For example, here is what Rothbard says in &lt;em&gt;For A New Liberty&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Freedom is a condition in which a person’s ownership rights in his own body and his legitimate material property are not invaded, are not aggressed against. A man who steals another man’s property is  invading  and  restricting  the  victim’s  freedom,  as  does  the man  who  beats  another  over  the  head… &lt;strong&gt;Freedom and unrestricted property rights go hand in hand.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:ancap4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:ancap4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is farcical, however: a real definition of liberty that maps meaningfully onto the very reasons &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; give for valuing it would not, and does not, correspond simply to whether &lt;em&gt;property rights&lt;/em&gt; have been violated in one’s person or the product of one’s labor. This is something that is often repeatedly pointed out to them, but usually from a statist or communist angle; however, statism and communism, while they may protect individual autonomy from property in one respect, also massively curtail individual autonomy in so many other respects that the criticism (somewhat rightly) falls on deaf ears: libertarians value liberty/autonomy, so of course they will not be interested in the arguments of those who want to create more liberty in one area only to destroy it in so many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the process of elevating property rights, as a hidden representative for individual liberty or autonomy, to the top of their value hierarchies, many libertarians, especially anarcho-capitalists, start to treat property rights as absolutes: for them, property rights must not be violated under &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; circumstances. This leads to absurdities such as the suggestion that one should not clamber onto a private lifeboat if the owner has not invited you aboard. This is a more fundamental confusion about values: in confusing property for liberty itself, anarcho-capitalists come to conclusions that would only make sense if that were absolutely and completely true, conclusions which we know to be absurd because that is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; true. If property &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; the ultimate value, voluntarily committing suicide by jumping off a cliff to avoid trespassing on some landowner’s property would sound totally sensible to someone comitted to liberty, but it &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; precisely because that is not what we value!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a system that optimized for individual liberty or autonomy directly, Lockean property rights might be a general rule, but there would also be systemic limitations of that kind of property rights &lt;em&gt;in order to preserve absolute individual autonomy&lt;/em&gt; (not in order to preserve the ‘public good’ or the state).  The property rights more directly respected might be more along the lines of use and occupancy norms, not the absolute dictats of absentee property and Neo-Lockean natural rights. This would ensure that those who actually &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; property (to extend their autonomy), for instance, as a place to live and have a sphere separate from the spheres of others, or as a means to produce with one’s labor, would be guaranteed that ability, maximizing autonomy and individuality from others for them, while those who would use the sole access to property (protected by force) to dominate and exploit others would be unable to do so, also maximizing autonomy for all. This is not a consequentialist calculus in the traditional sense either; it is just that each person who values their own autonomy will cease to respect the claims to rights of those who use those rights to restrict their autonomy severely, especially if those claims are not themselves strongly based in protecting autonomy.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:ancap1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:ancap1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-cultural-problems&quot;&gt;2. Cultural Problems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, there is a problem with the culture surrounding anarcho-capitalism, that made me hesitant to associate myself with the label, preferring ‘market anarchist’ even before I became a left-market anarchist and/or mutualist. That problem stems from a fundamental inconsistency between the cultural and social beliefs of the people that involve themselves with the right-libertarian movement, and those that would &lt;em&gt;most naturally&lt;/em&gt; follow from their core values. This is something I laid out even before I became a left-market anarchist, in ‘Synthesis Libertarianism: A Manifesto’: the values of individual autonomy, fairness, and concern for the historical acquisition of just property means that a consistent libertarian would &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to take on leftist values. Tradition destroys individuality, social coercion binds people into identical little communities, and authority, even when not backed up by the threat of force, makes people less autonomous, less free. If you truly wanted a community of people that was as independant and free as possible, one that was the least likely to be swayed by the rhetoric of some would-be ruler, would you not want independant thinkers who apply their reason to figuring out the best solutions for themselves in their individual situation, instead of blindly applying the solutions of their forefathers? Yet, right-libertarians seem &lt;em&gt;predominantly&lt;/em&gt; culturally right-leaning: they think that ‘Western values’ and ‘Judeo-Christian morality’ are the only valid ways to live, and are the last bulwarks standing between life as we know it and chaos/communism. They think the ‘nuclear family’ and the ‘protestant work ethic’ are the ways to achieve economic prosperity and a meaningful life. These are not the beliefs of consistent human beings in favor of individual liberty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is because many anarcho-capitalists are proto- or crypto-fascists. I do not level this accusation lightly, as some of my comrades do on the left. No, I mean this literally. Many in the Mises Institute circle, which is where most ancaps exist, come from an alt-right, neo-Nazi, and/or Neo-Confederate background&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:ancap6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:ancap6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and they have &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; left behind those values. Instead, they have merely adopted a new cloak under which to hide them. They embrace property rights not because they actually want people to be free to live their own lives, but because they personally do not want to be interefered-with by people they disagree with, and because they want to be left alone to make microstates (‘covenant communities’) where they can build little ethnostates in peac. Even this commitment to being ‘left alone’ is only really because they do not think they &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; seize the apparatus of state and cultural power; if they could, they would do so in an instant, and cast aside all their ‘libertarian’ trappings. This can be seen also in how little bothered they are with the restrictions on actual human liberty that property can bring about — in fact, they welcome them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To back up my claims a little here, let us read some quotes from Hans-Hermann Hoppe, the main inheritor of Rothbard’s legacy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In a covenant concluded among proprietor and community tenants for the  purpose of protecting their private property, no such thing as a right to free (unlimited) speech exists… naturally no one is permitted to advocate ideas contrary to the very purpose of the covenant of preserving and protecting private property, such as democracy and communism. There can be no tolerance toward democrats and communists in a libertarian social order. They will have to be physically separated and expelled from society. Likewise, in a covenant founded for the purpose  of protecting family and kin, there can be no tolerance toward those  habitually promoting lifestyles incompatible with this goal. They – the  advocates of alternative, non-family and kin-centered lifestyles such  as, for instance, individual hedonism, parasitism, nature-environment  worship, homosexuality, or communism – will have to be physically  removed from society, too, if one is to maintain a libertarian order.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:ancap2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:ancap2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That may not seem &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; bad, merely an application of freedom of association and property rights in land, but the problem is not that Hoppe &lt;em&gt;allows&lt;/em&gt; such things (necessarily, anyway; there is more to be discussed about &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;), it is that he &lt;em&gt;gleefully&lt;/em&gt; pictures the worst and most segregationist, fascist-adjacent applications of what property rights technically allow, and advocates for them! His personal views are even more odius:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Did this not imply that vulgarity, obscenity, profanity, drug use,  promiscuity, pornography, prostitution, homosexuality, polygamy,  pediphilia or any other conceivable perversity or abnormality, insofar  as they were victimless crimes, were no offenses at all but perfectly  normal and legitimate activities and lifestyles?&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:ancap3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:ancap3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gets worse. The same passage continues, saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, then, from the outset the libertarian movement attracted an unusually high number of abnormal and perverse followers. Subsequently, the countercultural ambiance and multicultural-relativistic “tolerance” of the libertarian movement attracted even greater numbers of misfits, personal or professional failures, or plain losers… They fantasized of a society where everyone would be free to choose and cultivate whatever nonaggressive lifestyle, career, or character he [sic] wanted, and where, as a result of free-market economics, everyone could do son an elevated level of general prosperity. Ironically, the movement that had set out to dismantle the state and restore private property and market economics was largely appropriated, and its apperance shaped, by the mental and emotional products of the welfare state: the new class of permanent adolescents.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:ancap3:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:ancap3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are we to understand, then, that homosexuality (to say nothing of the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; sexualities that exist) are ‘abnormal’ and ‘perverse,’ to be mentioned in the same class as pedophiles? That it is a sign of ‘permanent adolescence’ and a product of the ‘welfare state’? Are libertarians &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to desire a society in which everyone is free, tolerant, and better-off? This is the kind of company one must keep, if one is to be an anarcho-capitalist, and this is not company one would want to keep if one was committed to any kind of sane and non-bigoted principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gets worse, too. Since Rothbard’s alliance with the New Left fell apart (which is what Hoppe is talking about above), the primary effort among anarcho-capitalist circles has been to “unite the right.” That is, to ally with fascists, neo-Nazis, neo-reactionaries (scientific racists and anti-feminists), and other alt-right ideologies, simply because they (to some degree) also value property rights. This is dangerous for obvious reasons, because the sort of intellectual cross-pollination and pandering that happens when this sort of thing is done has real effects on the intellectual as well as cultural development of the movement. Moreover, the fact that ancaps would be so willing to work with such dispicable people denotes a severe lack of care for real issues of oppression, which are readily to be expected when someone puts property, and property alone, at the top of their value hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is more, but I think I have made it crystal clear that there is something fundamentally broken about anarcho-capitalist values, both culturally and philosophically. It should also be clear, being a bisexual transgender woman in a polyamorous relationship, why I do not feel comfortable associating with these people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-a-fundamental-misunderstanding-of-markets&quot;&gt;3. A Fundamental Misunderstanding of Markets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem with anarcho-capitalists is that their picture of ‘free markets’ assumes that, besides a few changes here and there, the elimination of the state will lead to largely the same market structure, with its prevalence of corporate hierarchies, that we see today. They confuse &lt;em&gt;capitalism&lt;/em&gt; for a necessary and unavoidable result of &lt;em&gt;markets&lt;/em&gt;, in much the way Marxists do. They seem incapable of grasping, or unwilling to grasp, either the revolutionary nature of their economics, or the radical structural distortions that the existence of the state and its regulations might actually be responsible for.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:ancap1:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:ancap1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; A picture of truly free&lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt; markets could be radically different than what we see today, but besides cherry picking regulations to talk about whenever people criticize modern capitalism, they seem incapable of seeing the bigger picture. Anarcho-capitalists seem quite happy, on a case-by-case basis, to respond to each criticism that people give of free markets with an explanation of why that criticism is the result of state intervention, but somehow it does not add up in their heads to a picture of systematic priviledge and distortion, as it does for me and those who share my views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also seem unwilling to consider the idea that, thanks to state-aided primitive (but ongoing) accumulation (of the less-than-savory sort, contra Adam Smith), many or most of the modern gigantic corporations and oligarchs do not deserve their wealth, and should be stripped of it if possible. Anarcho-capitalists seem perfectly happy to be apologists for big business and the corporate elites even as &lt;em&gt;even their own&lt;/em&gt; principles leave them nowhere to stand on the matter. I can only speculate that this is born out of an affection for the current order, a desire for it not to change &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; dramatically (maybe losing a few taxes here and there), because it largely &lt;em&gt;works for them.&lt;/em&gt; They do not seem ready to accept the fact that pushing for the abolition of the state might actually (this is my shocked face) have some &lt;em&gt;radical implications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-excessive-normativity&quot;&gt;4. Excessive Normativity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem with anarcho-capitalism is its strange assumption that, without the state or any other centralized mechanism of enforcing law, the same set of moral norms will, and must, be followed. Somehow they expect that, under anarchism, a system that is inherently diverse, fluid, decentralized, and distributed, everything will form up around a particular (and particularly rigid) conception of the free market and property rights. Even if they wanted to advocate for following those norms themselves, and to convince others to follow them, there is &lt;em&gt;no way&lt;/em&gt; that it would be possible (or even moral if it were possible even according to their own rules) to ensure such a uniform adherence. Anarchists often appeal (justifiably) to culture to prevent hierarchies, authority, and the state from forming, but culture is not that powerful, nor that unified in motive force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the inherent absurdity at the heart of Rothbard’s book &lt;em&gt;The Ethics of Liberty&lt;/em&gt;: he sets out an incredibly specific set of laws which he expects, and desires, anarchist societies to follow, and believes that simply because they are (supposedly) derived from natural facts about humans, everyone will naturally fall to following them. That is simply not the case, as can be seen by &lt;em&gt;all of human history&lt;/em&gt;, not to mention the fundamentally infertile nature of natural law itself as a form of ethics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The desire to force an anarchist society to some &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; set of norms leads to the height of all absurdities: an anarchist &lt;em&gt;constitution&lt;/em&gt;. The fanciful idea behind this is that the market, by some natural homogenizing mechanism, will ensure that, eventually, polycentric law will give way to law that is primarily made after a single template, &lt;em&gt;and that that template will be one that anarcho-capitalists draw up.&lt;/em&gt; This is simply ludicrous on a number of levels. First of all, it ignores the many variations of individualist anarchism, the varying cultural and ethical beliefs that people have about what is just, fair, and right. It igores the fluid and extremely diverse needs of various communities. It also igores the fact that competition, on features as well as pricing, is an inherent product of markets. Not to mention the fact that if law &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; tend to unify in this way, it would be akin to the claim that markets lead to monopoly: not a very &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; claim, actually, for a market anarchist of any stripe to make!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-conclusion&quot;&gt;4. Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not claiming that every anarcho-capitalist shares the exact same views regarding these things. However, I think I am stating what the vast majority of them believe and value, and something that is justifiably viewed as the paradigmatic version of anarcho-capitalism, based on what the main philosophical texts they treat as gospel say. Furthermore, although the culture I describe in anarcho-capitalist circles is not universal — I was a part of a group of right-libertarians on Quora that was not quite this bad — it is a very strong overall trend. I think there are very good reasons, therefore, to be skeptical of anarcho-capitalism as a philosophy, and I would highly recommend that anyone who adheres to it look into individualist anarchism outside of that sphere, including  mutualism.&lt;/p&gt;

The Problem With ‘Objective’ Ethics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The common discourse surrounding ethical philosophy in the mainstream is, I contend, largely meaningless. It is dominated by discussions over reified abstractions that have no real ties either to normativity or reality, phantoms which require only a little thought and a single question — “why should I care?” — to disperse. Under the rubric of mainstream ethics, the words “good” and “evil” seem ultimately to break down to “things I desire to do/see done” and “things I do not desire to do/see done,” but yet they are infused with notions of ontological existence separate from any mind or desire. I believe this is, at its base, where mainstream ethical philosophy has gone horribly wrong, and a return to a subjectivistic and egoistic understanding of morality having its foundation in personal desires is necessary to locate a moral philosophy that people can be &lt;em&gt;happy&lt;/em&gt; following, and agree on, while eliminating all of the confusion in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that moral statements are ultimately reducible to desires is not surprising. Moral statements are ultimately supposed to motivate action, and the ability to motivate action ultimately breaks down to appealing to desires. It is impossible to motivate any individual to act without some preexisting desire on their part that can be appealed to by explaining how that action actually serves that desire. As Hume said, knowledge of some truth alone does not motivate a person to action; there must be some use they want to put that knowledge to, something they want to avoid or gain, for them to be interested in acting on the basis of any statement of fact:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;’Tis obvious, that when we have the prospect of pain or pleasure from  any object, we feel a consequent emotion of aversion or propensity, and  are carry’d to avoid or embrace what will give us this uneasiness or  satisfaction. ’Tis also obvious, that this emotion rests not here, but  making us cast our view on every side, comprehends whatever objects are  connected with its original one by the relation of cause and effect.  Here then reasoning takes place to discover this relation; and according as our reasoning varies, our actions receive a subsequent variation.  But ’tis evident in this case, that the impulse arises not from reason,  but is only directed by it. ’Tis from the prospect of pain or pleasure  that the aversion or propensity arises towards any object: And these  emotions extend themselves to the causes and effects of that object, as  they are pointed out to us by reason and experience. It can never in the least concern us to know, that such objects are causes, and such others effects, if both the causes and effects be indifferent to us. Where the objects themselves do not affect us, their connexion can never give  them any influence; and ’tis plain, that as reason is nothing but the  discovery of this connexion, it cannot be by its means that the objects  are able to affect us.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:e1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:e1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since moral science is therefore ultimately based in attempting to unearth certain innate desires that can motivate us to act one way or another, there is a perennial search for certain states of being or actions that are so intuitively positive or negative that the human mind cannot &lt;em&gt;help&lt;/em&gt; but have a certain propensity for them or aversion to them (a certain desire regarding them, in other words), so that anyone who reads a moral treatise based on the application of an analysis of things in terms of those states is motivated to act on the rules and precepts found therein. The common use of moral thought experiments, such as the trolley problem, or extreme moral hypotheticals (such as child murder, etc) reveals this in bright colors: the only reason such hypotheticals or problems work is because they ignite deep and intuitive desires in the people that hear them, that then motivates them to change their actions or beliefs to allow for that desire. Attempting to understand the deep innate desires humans have often requires an analysis of &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt;, precisely, the innate desires of human beings are, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The desire to motivate everyone who reads one’s moral treatise, instead of just those who already share one’s obvious and specific desires, also leads to an incentive to phrase things in terms of &lt;em&gt;anything but&lt;/em&gt; simple desires, because if the subjectivity of the basis for a moral treatise becomes clear, it becomes easier for people to reject it. That is why in common moral discourse all things tend to &lt;em&gt;reduce&lt;/em&gt; to desires, but the fact that that is the case is often very obfuscated. Thus we arrive at the second problem with moral discourse I referenced in the opening paragraph: all moral logic must ultimately appeal to desire if it wants to motivate action, but there is a strong push to hide this fact and locate deeper and deeper, more intuitive desires, at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis of innate desires is itself extremely problematic, however, which brings us to why the other feature of common moral discourse, the meaninglessness and unmooring of moral concepts, is unsurprising. Oftentimes, the intuitive desires of philosophers &lt;em&gt;regarding&lt;/em&gt; certain states are confused for properties &lt;em&gt;of&lt;/em&gt; those objects, leading to a confusion of desirability (a property that objects have only in connection with the mind) for an ontological property. This can be seen in various forms of Platonism, natural law, and divine command theory. This is what the classic is-ought dilemma is attempting to point out: desirability, or valuability, is not a property of objects (whether conceptual or actual) themselves, and so an analysis that contents itself solely with dealing in facts (properties of objects) will not be able to graduate to the status of normative import without fallacy, or at least a hidden premise regarding desires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, attempts to describe these desires in detail, when they are not confused for ontological properties of the objects and so left aside for detailed and futile analyses of the states of the world themselves, are described too rigidly and yet too inexactly because of how they differ in personal situations. This is seen in virtue ethics and, to a certain degree, deontology. This inaccurate description of innate desires happens because human beings do not have direct insight into what we desire; we extrapolate what we actually desire based on the inclinations that we feel, indications of others, and past experiences, and so whenever we come up with a model of what we desire it is necessarily a map, not the territory. When we make that map a part of our moral system, however, we end up serving something that is only an inexact representation of our true desires and values, which causes us unnecessary pain and contradiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In either case, whether we objectify desires into objects, or petrify them into concepts, we end up taking the true reasons why we act on something — that we have a desire for it — and reifying it into something external, which we then serve as if it was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; just an inexact and externalized description of our own wants and needs. This is harmful to us as individuals for many reasons, and can also be harmful for others insofar as we are possessed of empathy and would, in the absence of such phantoms possessing us, try to help others and avoid harming them. This is why people who have a rigid and exacting morality are not often actually viewed positively by those who have not also bought into the same morality: they know that that person is a ticking time-bomb, ultimately a danger to themselves and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-egoist-ethics&quot;&gt;2. Egoist Ethics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To admit that all ethical thought and action is in pursuit of some desire that the individual has is to admit egoism: I do things not because I &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt;, because I am inherently required or motivated to do them by something external to me by some metaphysical process, but because I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to do those things. This solves the problem that can be found in most ethical systems, where by some strange loop of logic the philosopher attempts to prove that something is valuable, without providing a reason why anyone should care. When Plato talks about the form of the Good, I ask: “why should I seek it?” When Christians talk about the nature of God, and why I should become more like it, I ask: “why should I become something other than myself?” The answers in all cases such as these, when they are motivating in the least, appeal to my desires: “you will live a happier life if you seek the Good,” “you will go to heaven instead of hell.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, if we were to accept without embarrassment the fact that we are always acting on the basis of our desires anyway, we would not &lt;em&gt;lose&lt;/em&gt; anything by doing so (because we were never acting otherwise anyway), and would gain much in satisfaction, with ourselves and others. This need not turn us into selfish, cold-hearted monsters, as many opponents of egoism would have you believe: not all desires are purely self-regarding. Some desires, perhaps very many of them, are positive and pro-social, and there is just as much reason to act in favor of those as to act in favor of others. If you feel a horror at the thought of yourself becoming a cruel and heartless person, thieving and stealing at will, when you consider becoming an egoist, then you are &lt;em&gt;already safe&lt;/em&gt;, because all you need do is act on those desires not to become a person like that, which is allowed within the egoist framework. The only change the egoist framework asks of you is that you be &lt;em&gt;conscious&lt;/em&gt; of what you are doing and do it well. To quote Max Stirner:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sacred things exist only for the egoist who does not acknowledge himself, the involuntary egoist, for him who is always looking after his own and yet does not count  himself as the highest being, who serves only himself and at the same  time always thinks he is serving a higher being, who knows nothing  higher than himself and yet is infatuated about something higher; in  short, for the egoist who would like not to be an egoist, and abases  himself (combats his egoism), but at the same time abases himself only  for the sake of “being exalted,” and therefore of gratifying his egoism. Because he would like to cease to be an egoist, he looks about in  heaven and earth for higher beings to serve and sacrifice himself to;  but, however much he shakes and disciplines himself, in the end he does  all for his own sake, and the disreputable egoism will not come off him. On this account I call him the involuntary egoist.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:e2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:e2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must always remember that &lt;em&gt;the map is not the territory&lt;/em&gt;: while each higher concept  or principle that human beings have served (from gods to humanity, from collectivism to property) may perhaps be to some degree a tool for shedding light  on some &lt;em&gt;part&lt;/em&gt; of our desires, these concepts are not absolute, and we will be happier and better people if we treat them as general principles or rules of thumb, always ultimately in service of ourselves. Make others happy because it makes &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; happy, not because you think you must, because the &lt;em&gt;concept&lt;/em&gt; of helping others is agreeable to you. Respect property because it is useful to do so, not because it is a fundamental motivating principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might seem like a surrender, relinquishing the field of ethics to the subjectivists, but that is not the case. There are still deeper desires generally shared by humans that we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; appeal to, or prerequisites and assumptions for all egoism and desire that can be spoken about, or general principles about what is in our interests that hold true; we do not give up the ability to tell someone that they should or should not do something, necessarily. We just lose the absolutism and rigidity of ‘objective’ moral judgements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, we do not lose the ability to interfere in the matters of others: if something goes against our values, if we do not wish to see something happen, why &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; stop it? The fundamental contradiction inherent in moral relativism does not apply here: if no morality but my own, based on my own desires and beliefs, holds sway over me, there is nothing to prevent me from stopping others from doing things I consider immoral. I do not have to refrain from interference with the morality of others, because such a principle itself would have to be absolute and objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, a declaration of something as ‘evil’ is often encapsulated in this: a statement that one will not permit something, will not accept it or stand for it.  When I declare something evil — and this is true for unwilling egoists too — it is a pledge that I would not do that thing, and I would not allow any others, if it is in my power, to do that thing either. It is a statement of stance, not of objective fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we do not lose the ability to convince people to value the things we value, or desire the things we desire, through rhetoric and philosophy, just as we have before; so-called objective ethics was no advantage in doing this, and setting it aside will lose us nothing. We will still even be able to form compromises with those who will not share our desires, just as we have done before, without the added complication of each side insisting that &lt;em&gt;they alone&lt;/em&gt; are right in everything. Those who truly will not listen to such persuasion, the ‘crazed axe murderers’ of amateur moral hypotheticals, were lost to reasoning about ‘objective’ moral values anyway; no philosophy will reach them anyway!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-conclusion&quot;&gt;3. Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accepting the desire-based and subjective nature of ethics will, I propose, fundamentally solve the field’s problems. Right now, it is mired in obfuscation and confusion, but understanding that all normativity is based in individual, egoistic desire-satisfaction would allow us to analyze more deeply the kinds of things most people desire, and to convince others with compassion and clarity. Instead of beating others over the head with some product of conceptual analysis or some fact of nature which has no obvious inherent relation to what they should do, we can appeal to things that people actually care about, and not pretend the validity of our desires depends on our ability to convince absolutely everyone of them; we will be free to deal with those who do not share them as necessary, without questioning our own values because we cannot convince every skeptic.&lt;/p&gt;

While conservatives are intolerant of other lifestyles, other races, LGBTQ+ people, immigrants, and so on, progressives are just as intolerant of bigots, racists, sexists, and authoritarians. They are equally intolerant, just of different things. There’s something crucially wrong with this statement, however, and in this post I want to briefly analyze what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, when conservatives point out that progressives, who are all about tolerance, are &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; intolerant of certain things, they are pointing at what Karl Popper called ‘the paradox of tolerance’. Basically, the core problem is that if we want a society where people are free to live their lives in peace, without the censure, constant criticism, and discrimination or bigotry of others, we must actually censure, criticize, and discriminate against those who do not want such a society. If we want to be free of Christians preaching that all those who live in ways that are different from the narrow, unhealthy, prudish norms that they adhere to will burn in a lake of eternal fire, we must be willing to raise our voices against them. In the eyes of conservatives, all they are doing when they are preaching against homosexuality or whatever the big scare of the day is, is criticizing things they don’t like, so when progressives criticize them for doing it, it looks like progressives are being hypocrites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core fallacy here is that of being over-specific: looking at only the specific actions that progressives take, and not why they take them and the context within which they occur. One way I like to explain this, and why the paradox of tolerance is not a paradox, is by comparison to something like the Non-Aggression Principle: only use violence against those who initiate it first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you only use violence against people who used violence on innocent people, then you are not the same as the person that uses violence against innocent people. In fact, you are explicitly set against that: if everyone would stop using violence against innocent people, you would stop using violence as well, so in a world where everyone follows the rule that you do, there will be no violence against innocents, meaning your rule HAS to be against such violence. The key difference is that on the one hand you have a person that will use violence for whatever reason, unqualified, and on the other hand, you have someone who will only use violence in response to the  first kind of person. Those are clearly two different kinds of people, and they are not on the same level whatsoever. This is basically what self-defense is, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applying this logic to tolerance and intolerance,  there is a crucial difference between people who will be intolerant of people who aren’t hurting anyone and haven’t done anything to them, and people who will only be intolerant of the first kind of person, only intolerant in response to unprovoked intolerance.  These are clearly two different kinds of people, because on the one hand you’ll have someone who will be intolerant of people for purely personal and arbitrary reasons, on the basis of what they merely find, gross or unusual or unfamiliar, and on the other hand you will have people that are intolerant for the purpose of protecting others and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, there is a difference between provoked intolerance, and simple bigoted intolerance. This is pretty clear from the fact that no one bats an eye when we are intolerant towards murderers, rapists, etc. Why? Because they hurt someone, they did something to deserve intolerance in response. That, to a lesser degree because it is usually nonviolent, is what intolerant people have done: they have done something to others that has justly provoked the resentment of the rest of society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is intolerant, technically, to not want to hang out with an asshole. But it’s not the kind of intolerance people are talking about when they’re talking about being “against intolerance.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alexis</name></author><category term="lgbtq" /><category term="politics" /><category term="ethics" /><summary type="html">One of the common refrains you will here from the conservative/anti-SJW/’politically incorrect’ sphere is that progressives are just as intolerant as they are, just of different things.

Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Up to now the victories of justice over injustice and of equality over inequality have been won by instinct and the simple force  of things, but the final triumph of our social nature will be due to our reason, or else we shall fall back into feudal chaos. — Pierre-Joseph Proudhon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two principles, which, when generally followed, bring the best average results in life for an individual who follows them, and also form the basis of a society which benefits all the members thereof. These principles are the principle of reciprocity, and the principle of autonomy. Stated concisely, they can be phrased thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Principle of Autonomy&lt;/strong&gt;: each individual must value for themselves as free a range of choice for their own lives, time and labor as possible, and must abhor domination, oppression, and authority.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Principle of Reciprocity&lt;/strong&gt;: each individual should cooperate with as many individuals as will likely cooperate with them, and respond to the interactions of others in kind: refusal to cooperate should be met with refusal, cooperation met with cooperation, and antagonism with antagonism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two principles, when generally followed, produce for the individual that follows them the optimal conditions to allow that individual to flourish, by fostering the best kinds of relationships between that individual and their community. When all other individuals in that community also follow these rules, these benefits are multiplied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moral force of this treatise, insofar as it can be called ‘moral’ at all, is therefore contained in a form of egoistic rule-consequentialism: it constitutes  advice, and general principles for action, which it would be wise for the self-interested individual to take heed of. No principle to be found herein is absolute; each is subject to the overriding force of holistic self-interested considerations, but neither should any principle be completely without force in the considerations of a rational individual. They should be followed by default, as a general course of action, because they produce positive outcomes far more often than they produce negative ones, and attempting to calculate the most beneficial action in each situation is too prone to error. Essentially, the prior probability in every situation is set strongly in favor of these principles, and so a lot of evidence would need to be gathered to be sure that going against them is a good idea, so only in situations where the benefits are clear and obvious should the principles be ignored. Thus the core of this treatise is an exhortation: if you want to promote your own autonomy and welfare, and moreover if you wish to cultivate a society with more of those things for all its members, then listen to what I say and consider it, because I think I present a good way to achieve those things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a positivist, amoral aspect to my analysis: because human beings are generally self-interested in tendency, if not in every specific action, and also because of how we have evolved as a social species to act reciprocally even when it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; strictly in our best interest in each case, there will be a strong tendency in a free society of people not possessed so strongly by other ideas (about authority and legitimacy, perhaps) to fall into line with my advice without needing to be told to do so. That way, not only can I describe how I believe an egoistic actor should generally want things to be, but I can also speak about how they will &lt;em&gt;tend&lt;/em&gt; to be in an anarchic state of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following sections, I will explain why these two principles are indeed as beneficial as I claim, and then I will elaborate on them in more detail, explaining the implications of consistently applying these principles to various areas of political, social, and economic life. Although I attempt to draw out these implications by clear logical deduction, because each principle and its corollaries are necessarily general rules not to be applied in every situation, my statements concerning their implications are &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; general rules, as are my statements concerning the &lt;em&gt;benefits&lt;/em&gt; of following any of these principles, corollaries, and implications. Therefore, consider all of my statements as statements of general fact, open to revision in the moment and in light of particular circumstances. Additionally, since this is an ethic for humans and for humans to interact with humans, I find it acceptable from time to time to use extraneous implicit axioms and intuitions, although I try to justify them wherever they crop up as particularly central to any argument. Please keep all of this in mind when reading further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;21-what-is-autonomy&quot;&gt;2.1. What Is Autonomy?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autonomy&lt;/strong&gt; is the freedom to choose what to do with one’s body, time, and labor. To think, speak, and act as one wills. We all, technically, have the &lt;em&gt;ability&lt;/em&gt; to do those things, even if there is a gun held to our heads, but to be free to do them means to have a range of choices about what to do with them that are all serious options — options that do not in themselves represent serious choices that will further narrow agency or destroy the capacity for it in a significant way, or cause significant harm to the individual. Thus, I am not in fact free to do what I want with my time, I do not have autonomy, if my choices are to do what you want or to starve because you withhold food from me, because my choices are limited to two, one which represents axiological (and actual) suicide, essentially, and the choice you present. Thus, I have autonomy to the degree that there are no serious obstacles to me choosing to do what I want with myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I do not use the words ‘freedom’ or ‘liberty’ to describe this value, and instead prefer to say autonomy, is that freedom and liberty are, particularly in a right-libertarian context but even outside of it, associated with a specific conception of ‘rights’ that is unhelpful to my analysis, and allowing such a connotation to creep it would only serve to muddy the waters for those familiar with most discourse around rights and freedoms. In this conception, one is free just in case one can do whatever one has a right to do, and any action that one is prevented from taking outside that sphere has, in this conception, no effect on one’s freedom, either to lessen it or increase it. Here is an example from Rothbard, from &lt;em&gt;For A New Liberty&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Freedom is a condition in which a person’s ownership rights in his own body and his legitimate material property are not invaded, are not aggressed against. A man who steals another man’s property is  invading  and  restricting  the  victim’s  freedom,  as  does  the man  who  beats  another  over  the  head… &lt;strong&gt;Freedom  and  unrestricted property right go hand in hand.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:41&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:41&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, in this conception, the fact that I cannot take some food from you, even if I need it, is not a restriction on my freedom, because you have a &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; to that food. This conception of freedom is merely an imperfect representation of what is actually valuable about freedom, however, which is clear from the example that I gave in the first paragraph: if I am presented with two choices, one which represents axiological or actual suicide, and one which does not, then it should be clear that by any normal definition of freedom I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; free to simply reject the other option. I am &lt;em&gt;forced&lt;/em&gt;, the common usage of the term, to take the other option. This is why we say ‘I have to work’ or ‘my boss is forcing me to do’ this or that: yes, technically, we can stop working altogether, or disobey our boss, but if we do that, we likely face starvation and homelessness, at least ultimately, so we do not have any other real, live options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should be made even clearer by the fact that, in the standard rights-based conception of freedom, I am no more or less free whether I am a beggar on the street, owning nothing more than the clothes on my back and the labor I can produce, and a tech mogul living an opulent life across five mansions, capable of going anywhere or getting anything at the snap of my finger. Clearly, this is a strange conception of freedom. Moreover, it is a conception of freedom that does not see a hindrance to my ability to choose what to do with my own body and time, when I am prevented from walking my body over someone else’s land (trespassing), etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, all freedom is important: any restriction on my autonomy, whether through bad and limited choices or by physical force, even when used to protect ‘rightful’ things, is a noticeable restriction on me. If you prevent me from eating by preventing me from accessing food that I have produced, or that you have produced, as far as I am concerned the effect is identical: I starve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that all autonomy is equally worth protecting. The free ability to choose what to do with my body, time, labor, and the products thereof, in spheres which effect few or no one besides myself, is autonomy that is far more important, and far more closely felt, ordinarily, than the ability to go somewhere else and harass someone else. Nevertheless, sometimes it is not: sometimes not being able to do something that might effect someone else is an incredible, costly hindrance, a severe restriction on autonomy. It is important to recognize when some autonomy in the ability to interfere with the business and lives of others has been given up in return for greater security in one’s own life, because sometimes more is given up when the former is released than is gained from the latter. Likewise, it is important to recognize that all talk of rights, property, and freedom defined in terms of these things is an imperfect approximation of what we actually care about what it comes right down to it, because we care about &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; freedom, and sometimes the freedom we care most deeply about does not map onto property rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;22-why-is-autonomy-important&quot;&gt;2.2. Why Is Autonomy Important?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; we care about autonomy so much? Another reason that I prefer to use the word autonomy instead of ‘freedom’ or ‘liberty’ is that the word autonomy has an implication of self-directedness and self-determination to it that is important for a holistic understanding of what it is, which in turn is necessary to understand why it is so valuable. It will therefore begin to become even clearer why autonomy is so valuable if we explore the psychological definition of it, and the words surrounding it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quoting from the APA Dictionary of Psychology, autonomy is “in self-determination theory more specifically, the experience of acting from choice, rather than feeling pressured to act. This form of autonomy is considered a fundamental psychological need that predicts well-being.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:43&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:43&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Self-determination theory, in turn, is defined as “the concept that regulation of behavior varies along a continuum from  externally controlled (e.g., to obtain rewards or avoid punishments) to  autonomous or intrinsically motivated (e.g., to have fun or explore  interests). The theory emphasizes the importance of &lt;a href=&quot;https://dictionary.apa.org/intrinsic-motivation&quot;&gt;intrinsic motivation&lt;/a&gt; for producing healthy adjustment and asserts that negative outcomes  ensue when people feel that they are driven mainly by external forces  and extrinsic rewards.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:44&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:44&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In other words, autonomy is partially so valuable because it means the ability to choose to do things because they are intrinsically valuable or choice-worthy to the individual, instead of to avoid punishments or gain external rewards. Furthermore, I would argue that it is more of an problem to have to act to avoid a punishment than gain a reward — more psychologically damaging, more restricting of the ability to follow one’s own goals, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we have self-determination, so that choices flow from our own internal motivations and/or the goals in the external world that we seek, self-directedness becomes possible for us. Here is a definition of self-directedness, to bring this into focus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Self-directedness can be seen as the executive branch of a person’s  system of mental self-government. People who are self-directed recognize that their attitudes, behaviors, and problems reflect their own choices. They tend to accept responsibility for their attitudes and  behavior and they impress others as reliable and trustworthy persons. As a result, a person’s self-directedness is an important indicator of  reality testing, maturity, and vulnerability to mood disturbance.  Self-directedness is high in people who are mature and happy (Cloninger &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-28099-8_1163-1#CR2&quot;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;), whereas it is low in people with personality disorders and those  vulnerable to psychoses and mood disorders (Cloninger et al. &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-28099-8_1163-1#CR6&quot;&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;; Cloninger and Cloninger &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-28099-8_1163-1#CR3&quot;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:42&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:42&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is impossible, or much more difficult, to feel that one’s attitudes, behaviors, and problems reflect one’s own choices when those choices themselves were ones someone was forced to take. If someone was really pressured into taking a certain course of action, it is generally recognizable that they are &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; responsible for that choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the absence of autonomy, whatever actions that the individual takes, because they are made at the command, and therefore ultimately the decision, of another, for which the individual is not responsible, can have little joy for them, since it did not flow from them. Whatever they produce is not theirs, and their very time and life is not theirs to enjoy, is separated from them and made a kind of extension of another’s time and life in a kind of waking death. If life is good, subordination to another is evil for the very same reasons. Worse, when subordinated to another one is not free to build one’s own character as a human being, choose what to become. Instead, another person decides who you are, and you have little say in it, and so you become alienated from what you are. A slave who does whatever their owner commands because they need food is a person who becomes whoever their owner tells them to be, independent of anything actually stemming from them, and so becomes self-alienated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, living too long under the subordination of others will atrophy an individual’s capacity to make choices at all. What is unique to them slowly rots away from disuse, until they are dependent on their masters for everything. A person like this, even given their freedom, will not know what to do with it. We see this in those around us, and in ourselves, all the time: we do as teachers, priests, officials, or bosses tell us continuously, until the majority of our lives is consumed by being what other people want us to be, so that we become passive servants in our souls. Often, we do not remember how to learn something on our own, to produce on our own, to become our own person, to think on our own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autonomy also seems to be a core component of human flourishing, too: we have brains, can reason and make plans and choices for ourselves, and we are rewarded in mental health, satisfaction, and more for exercising that capacity, just as we are rewarded for exercising any capacity. Autonomy, self-determination, and the ability to self-actualize are key to psychological happiness&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:37&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:37&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:46&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:46&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. To become a full, well-rounded human being is not just some teleological end goal imposed upon us from the outside, but is also something that we can feel inside: there are rewards for becoming fully oneself, becoming fully human, exercising those capacities that make us so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a more fundamental reason that autonomy is crucially valuable, which allows me to treat it as a value that all human beings share — and provides the basis and framework for all others — without assuming that all human beings share the same values in other respects, as a moral realist would. This fundamental reason is that autonomy is the prerequisite for achieving all other values. If one is to pursue any value whatsoever, one must first have the freedom to do so: the freedom to use one’s own reasoning mind to choose what to do with one’s time and one’s body. If someone is subordinated to another they cannot be free to exercise their own mind and choice, and therefore cannot achieve any value of their own except at the sufferance of another, whose interests necessarily cannot be trusted to align with their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-reciprocity&quot;&gt;3. Reciprocity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“A man ought to be a friend to his friend and repay gift with gift. People should meet smiles with smiles and lies with treachery.” — &lt;em&gt;Edda&lt;/em&gt;, 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;31-positive-and-negative-reciprocity&quot;&gt;3.1. Positive and Negative Reciprocity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reciprocity, both in the community and in the individual, is what will safeguard  individual autonomy. Communities are composed of individuals, and therefore our first task is to explore how it is in the interest of the individual to engage in reciprocal respect of the interests and autonomy of others. Once that is established, we can speak about how a community of people who understand this common interest can operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one respects the autonomy of others, and interacts with them in a positive way, one is much more likely to be able to convince those others to respect one’s own autonomy, and to interact with oneself in mutually beneficial and positive ways. There are two reasons for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, because if you make it clear that you are treating other people positively in expectation of a return of that positive treatment, then they are incentivized to return it, in order to continue your positive treatment of them. If you do not return the positive cooperation I offer you, then reciprocity is broken, and I will cease to cooperate with you as well, ceasing to respect your autonomy and to give benefits to you when you do not respect mine and do likewise for me. Thus I motivate you to respond to my cooperation with like cooperation by the hopes on your part that I will cooperate with you, and you likewise motivate me to cooperate with you in the hopes that you will continue to cooperate with me. This is what is called a Nash equilibrium: because we both follow the same strategy, it is optimal for both of us to continue this strategy in most cases; otherwise, we loose benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, because human beings actually are &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; motivated by reciprocity than would be suggested by the purely rational calculus outlined above: we are motivated to cooperate with people who have cooperated with us even if it is a one time interaction&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and to go out of our way to cooperate with those who have cooperated with us, or punish those who did not, even when it is irrational to do so in a direct cost-benefit analysis&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. We are motivated to do this by feelings such as anger and resentment, but also friendship, trust, gratitude, and more. It would be foolish not to be aware of this aspect of human existence and actions in others. It would also be foolish to ignore these feelings in ourselves and try to stick to a rational decision theory only, as those feelings are their own negative or positive rewards, that, when not taken into account, take their own toll. Consider, also, that engaging in this form of positive reciprocity with others will actually encourage them to cooperate with you &lt;em&gt;even if they don’t like you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reciprocity is not always just about cooperation and goodwill, however. As mentioned when speaking about punishment and resentment above, in more extreme interactions, where someone not only ceases to cooperate positively, but actually does something negative, actors can respond with &lt;strong&gt;negative reciprocity&lt;/strong&gt;. If you actively violate my autonomy, and interact with me in a way that is unfair and deleterious to me, it is in my interest to repay that with like and proportional disregard and harm, so as to motivate you to cease doing that, and it is likewise in your interest to commit to the same strategy, to motivate me to avoid harming you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, in the case of negative reciprocity, one can only prove one’s commitment to this strategy of repaying harm with harm and unfairness with unfairness by action if someone else has already committed a harm or unfairness towards you, otherwise you would be the one ceasing cooperation first, so it is important to &lt;em&gt;verbally&lt;/em&gt; post one’s commitment to this strategy in order to make it known as a deterrant, whereas with positive reciprocity one can simply demonstrate with actions. Therefore, it is often beneficial to have explicit agreements or contracts with others concerning what will cause each of you to engage in negative reciprocity and to what degree, and to form mutual associations to multiply the force of such a commitment. Thus a “law” of sorts, built in game theoretic committment strategies and contracts, forms in the egalitarian world of mutual reciprocal interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proportionality is also crucially important when engaging in negative reciprocity: after all, if one engages in a grossly disproportionate act of retribution, others in the social mesh of mutual reciprocity that is the “community,” including and especially the ones you reacted against, are far more likely to view this as a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; violation of mutual respect for other’s autonomy, instead of a proper response. Meanwhile, if you stick to something in like kind and proportional, it will be clearer what it is a response to, and that it is not an overpayment. This is how one avoids blood feuds and the destruction of the social mesh that comes with such things. Importantly, the proportionality of the violation will have to be established mutually, through mediation with the one you are in conflict with, and socially if others are likely to act on behalf of the one you are retaliating against, or view you as a threat and cease positive reciprocation with you in return for perceived violations of proportionality (which it is in their interest to do, in order to incentivize everyone in the community to stay playing the reciprocal game even better).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, in a social situation where multiple people are all engaged in interactions with each other in a complex network, distributed cooperation or non-cooperation is possible. If one wants others to engage in sanctions against those who don’t cooperate with them and respect their autonomy, in order to multiply the power of their threats, or engage in cooperation with those who benefit them, to multiply the power of their bargaining, they need only promise to do likewise for the others (a contract which itself is enforced by positive and negative reciprocation), and it becomes possible for the the whole social network to become self-healing and self-reinforcing! Through the use of reciprocity, cooperation on the part of each of society’s members is rewarded, and harm punished, by not just the specific people involved, but by others as well (all, most, or just some). Thus if there are disparities in power between individuals, they can be evened out by the weaker individuals banding together to protect each other from the strong, and reward the strong even more generously for their cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ethic of reciprocity might begin to sound like the primitive ethics of “an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,” but there are crucial differences. Primarily, not hurting others (by being unfair to them, exploiting them, or by disrespecting their autonomy as individuals) is a form of positive cooperation with them, and therefore there is a positive clause to balance the negative one: “a gift for a gift and an eye for an eye.” Furthermore, this strategy, while primitive, is so lasting for a reason: it is actually, as I believe I have demonstrated, and has been extensively demonstrated in various scientific disciplines, one of the best strategies for actors that have to engage in repeated interactions with each other and/or can gain reputations.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:9&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:9&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:10&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:10&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;32-reciprocity-and-society&quot;&gt;3.2. Reciprocity and Society&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have demonstrated above that following the principles of reciprocity and autonomy is likely to be beneficial to each individual, whether or not those the interact also follow this ethic (but especially if they do). However, what benefits are there for promoting these principles generally, and encouraging an entire society to follow them? What, in other words, is the interest of the egoist in promoting others to follow this ethic besides the specific benefits contained in interacting with people who follow it? What are the benefits that are a result of the organic whole of society applying this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will sketch out the answer in brief. If society follows these as general principles, and treats a violation of positive reciprocity on the part one of its members as a violation to all of them, then one can expect to find a society in which it is most pleasing to live, as each interaction leaves both sides better off than before, and no one accepts subjugation of themselves, nor attempts to subjugate others. Every person gives a little of their autonomy, in choosing not to dominate others, in return for similar (and much greater because of the difference in number) consideration on the part of all others, while not really losing much, since autonomy as it is exercised in the domination of others is far less important than autonomy in one’s own labor and life choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a society, committed to the autonomy and mutual benefit of all, would be on average the best society to live in. Yes, there are a few who would be on the top of the hierarchy of a society which did not value these things, but the probability that any given person would be a member of that powerful elite is minuscule, and the conditions in such a society of the vast majority would be so far improved that the tiny probability of even greater advancement is outweighed by a rational calculus. That is not to mention the general benefit to all of more people being free and able to support themselves, in innovation and a healthier market and society at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to social anthropologists, reciprocity is actually a powerful basis for the success of our species and the formation of civilization, too. Quoting from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(social_psychology)#An_adaptive_mechanism&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; (because I don’t have access to the sources it is referencing, and because it’s quite clearly written):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Richard Leakey and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Lewin&quot;&gt;Roger Lewin&lt;/a&gt; attribute the very nature of humans to reciprocity. They claim humans  survived because our ancestors learned to share goods and services “in  an honored network of obligation”.&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(social_psychology)#cite_note-11&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; … &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_anthropology&quot;&gt;Cultural anthropologists&lt;/a&gt; support this idea in what they call the “web of indebtedness” where  reciprocity is viewed as an adaptive mechanism to enhance survival.&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(social_psychology)#cite_note-12&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; Within this approach, &lt;strong&gt;reciprocity creates an interdependent environment where labor is divided so that humans may be more efficient&lt;/strong&gt;… Each member can devote more time and attention to his or her allotted task and the whole group benefits. This meant that individuals could give away resources without actually  giving them away. Through the rule of reciprocity, sophisticated systems of aid and trade were possible bringing immense benefits to the  societies that utilized them.&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(social_psychology)#cite_note-:1-1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; Given the benefits of reciprocity at the societal level, it is not  surprising that the norm has persisted and dictates our present  cognition and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;33-why-reciprocity-consistently&quot;&gt;3.3. Why Reciprocity Consistently?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of relying on a distributed, decentralized network of reciprocal actions and game theoretic payoffs to protect one’s autonomy and interests, why not enforce it from the top down? Surely, if one desires to protect and ensure something absolutely, it is better to have a single entity that can impose it by force, for surely anything so loose and fluid as a reciprocal order cannot give as absolute guarantees!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not so. The introduction of unilateral force into any situation immediately gives everyone who you are using violence against an interest in rebelling against you. Worse, in instituting a system that is above you in order to safeguard your autonomy, you have placed your autonomy in its hands, and have it only at its sufferance. In your attempt to save your autonomy, you have in that very act destroyed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, creating an institution of centralized power introduces an ineradicable conflict between everyone around it. It becomes a race to capture power by those who have a vision of society that they wish to use that power to enforce — whether that power was intended for that end originally or not, power is fungible, and any institution powerful enough to protect your freedom is powerful enough to destroy it — and people who now have no choice but to struggle for power in order to, at the very least, prevent others from getting their hands on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more terribly, the introduction of unilateral force into a social network destroys all interest others might have in voluntarily helping you and cooperating with you: they will be subject to your violent invasions anyway, so they might as well acquiesce only at the point of your gun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, while the reciprocal order is a natural equilibrium point, an attempt to introduce a centralized means of control inherently and necessarily destabilizes any network of interactions, turning it into a race for control of the institution, and incentivizing all sides to use it for their own gain and to the detriment of others. The principles upon which such an institution stands, compromising autonomy for some for the purposes of others, subordinating all to its will and enforcing a singular outcome, requiring the fealty of those under it, are principles that undermine the possibility of freedom and mutual benefit. To introduce or support such a thing might benefit an individual in the short run, but ultimately endangers their own interests as well: if you create something that can unilaterally ignore the interests of others, you have no guarantee that it will always operate in your interests; and if you create a culture that sees it as acceptable to ignore the autonomy of some and subordinate them to you, you create a culture that accepts subordination, and sooner or later it will turn on you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another question that arises is why one should hold principles at all. Why not calculate out the benefits and costs of cooperation with others in each individual circumstance, and do as one pleases no matter what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to this is threefold. First, because being &lt;em&gt;known&lt;/em&gt; to have committed to a bargaining strategy, and taking steps to actually make it difficult to undo such a commitment, is an excellent way to actually get other people to cooperate with your strategy&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:38&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:38&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, as they feel they can trust you better. Compare this to someone who respects the autonomy and interests of others only when they feel like it, or only when the benefit to them is obvious and the ramifications of not doing so severe. No one will want to interact with such a person, as it is simply too dangerous. Therefore, self-interested considerations of the general, overall effects of one’s actions in a cumulative sense outweigh whatever one might think specifically and in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, because adhering to a principle unless in exceptional situations actually changes one’s habits and character, which is likely to make it far easier and more natural, and therefore even somewhat less costly, and certainly more safe and sure, to follow those principles. Committing to following certain principles, and building habits around them, is advantageous even if in some specific cases ignoring those principles is also advantageous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have hopefully demonstrated that the reciprocal ethic is an advantageous set of general principles to live by, and that a society founded on it will be far more stable and peaceful, and beneficial to each of its members instead of just a few, I can now freely continue elaborating it. In the next sections, I will be working out the implications, as I see them, of the two principles (autonomy and reciprocity) that compose this ethic. It should be noted that this is not an exercise in pure axiomatic deduction; instead, this is a working out of the implications of the reciprocal ethic by means of a combination of logic and intuition, as the task requires, since the point of this ethic is to foster understanding and cooperation between people, not purely philosophical robots, and so if something is a clear point of intuitive agreement, whether or not it can be fully justified from the ground up, it is acceptable. As long as the ethic clearly derives from a concern for individual autonomy and mutual reciprocity, it will serve to foster like concern in others, and eventually result in them following these principles as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;34-the-principles-of-reciprocity&quot;&gt;3.4. The Principles of Reciprocity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a fundamental difference between two kinds of positive reciprocity, and so far I have treated these two variations of reciprocity as equivalent for the sake of simplifying the foregoing conceptual analysis. I think it is time, however, to split them out, as I begin to formalize what the principles an individual following this ethic of reciprocity would follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two forms of positive reciprocity are &lt;em&gt;active&lt;/em&gt; positive reciprocity and &lt;em&gt;passive&lt;/em&gt; positive reciprocity. Passive positive reciprocity is cooperation with others to the extent of &lt;em&gt;avoiding&lt;/em&gt; taking certain actions towards them. This is best exemplified in positive reciprocity with respect to autonomy: to positively cooperate with someone in respecting their autonomy, all I need do is refrain from interfering with them. Conversely, active positive reciprocity is more stringent: I need to actually take a particular action that is different from the action I would have taken otherwise, in order to give a positive gain to the other person that they would not have received had I not taken that action. It is the act of giving a gift, as compared to the act of simply leaving someone alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passive positive reciprocity, because it usually requires so little from the person giving it, while increasing the liklihood of receiving something so important (safety from harm and theft, and one’s autonomy to act and pursue one’s own interests without being subordinated to or hindered unjustly by another) is a principle which holds effect in a far greater range of circumstances for a self interested actor than active positive reciprocity. After all, this ethic is only a set of heuristics and principles for a self-interested person to act by, not an absolute deontological set of rules handed down from on high, so if great enough needs arise, it can (and should) be cast to the wayside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why there is a greater expectation and focus, in my ethical and social writing, on passive positive reciprocity, in the respect for the autonomy and boundaries of others, than there is for active positive reciprocity, which is by far a more variable principle and depends almost exclusively on individual circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of this, the first and most important principle of the ethic of reciprocity is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-do-not-harm-others-if-they-have-not-harmed-you&quot;&gt;(1) &lt;strong&gt;DO NOT HARM OTHERS IF THEY HAVE NOT HARMED YOU.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the principle of passive positive reciprocity: cooperate with others, by &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; invading their boundaries and by respecting their autonomy, as long as they continue to do likewise and in the interests of encouraging them to do so. If they cease to cooperate with you, cease to cooperate with them: you are free to take positive action against them and their boundaries, to a proportionate degree. I will cover this in the next principle. If they begin cooperating again, return to cooperation with them, as that will ensure that they have an incentive to continue to cooperate with you, since if you will cease cooperating with them permamnently, they have no incentive to start cooperating again either, because you won’t respect them either way, and that way lies feud and gain for no one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always, then, the first principle is to maintain and continue and encourage &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt; passive reciprocal relations, whether that means opening with cooperation with new people, building up commitments and a reputation for such cooperation, or forgiving people (perhaps after some reparations to you) for ceasing to positively cooperate for awhile and returning to positively cooperating with them once that is done. The point is that when everyone engages in positively reciprocal, mutual relationships, everyone gains, and being willing to return to positive reciprocal relationships, after some punishment (either in negative reciprocation or just the cessation of positive reciprocation for a time), ensures that those who mess up or do bad things have an incentive to stop doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-if-someone-harms-you-harm-them-back-in-a-proportionate-manner&quot;&gt;(2) &lt;strong&gt;IF SOMEONE HARMS YOU, HARM THEM BACK IN A PROPORTIONATE MANNER.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is principle of negative reciprocity: if someone ceases cooperation with you, especially if they take action to disrespect your boundaries or your autonomy (negative action), you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; respond in like kind, in order to discourage them from doing so again, and therefore maintain positive reciprocal relations across the board. This means responding to negative actions towards you with negative actions (active negative reciprocity) and responding to a disregard of your autonomy, boundaries, or interests with like disregard (passive negative reciprocity).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be mindful, however, that the purpose is not simply to punish them for the sake of punishment, but to demonstrate a commitment to not being pushed around; furthermore, the purpose is not only or primarily to satisfy one’s own desires for revenge, but to do things rationally. Listening only to one’s desire for revenge is how you violate proporitionality in the eyes of the person you are in conflict with and the eyes of the community, breaking reciprocity yourself and making it worse for everyone. Thus it is better to act in a way that involves a punishment voluntarily agreed upon by the person who violated your autonomy and satisfactory, if relevant, to the rest of those with whom you wish to maintain positive relations, in the interests of placating everyone and returning to positive reciprocity while also disincentivizing violating it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it is in your interests to focus on making the ability to positively reciprocate whole again, which means ensuring that the person who hurt you is not themselves unilaterally or unsympathetically punished, and not resentful and unlikely to resume positive relations with you simply because you punished them. This means that negative reciprocation must be more voluntary than not on the part of all parties, even the one who initially broke reciprocity. This does not mean it must always be so, however, because in extreme enough cases the benefit of stopping or discouraging negative action far outweighs the dangers of permanently ending a chance for positively cooperative relations or proportionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-act-towards-others-as-you-would-have-them-act-towards-you-as-long-as-they-continue-to-do-likewise&quot;&gt;(3) &lt;strong&gt;ACT TOWARDS OTHERS AS YOU WOULD HAVE THEM ACT TOWARDS YOU, AS LONG AS THEY CONTINUE TO DO LIKEWISE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the principle of active positive reciprocity. This is actually in one’s own interest in fewer situations, and to a less significant degree. It should not dominate the wide middle swatch of payoffs the way the previous two rules should. However, when taken as the basis for mutual, peer-to-peer interaction and voluntary, fluid organization, it can be a very beneficial strategy indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultimate expression of this third principle of reciprocity is the gift economy and mutual aid, two principles of social organization not commonly associated with left-market anarchism, but perfectly compatible with it and actually endorsed by the principles outlined here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the gift economy, one grants needed items to others, with the hope and expectation that one one likewise needs something that other people have, they will grant it to you. Note that the concept of a gift economy relies on the concept of property being associated and rightfully aligned to a person, but simply being granted to others by its owners without a direct and upfront, proportional charge. Hence a gift economy is only possible within the context of a society that supports property as an extension of autonomy and reciprocally respects it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mutual aid&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:11&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:11&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is when participants, who view each other as equals, instead of charity-giver and charity-receiver, organize together in an attempt to help each other (and themselves by extension) and solve problems, by attempting to pool what they can give and take as little as possible (only what they need). Essentially, a voluntary organization along the lines of Marx’s classic saying “from each according to [their] ability, to each according to [their] need,” at a small enough scale that free rider problems can be avoided through social reprecussions, and within the context of individual autonomy instead of absolute individual subordination to the community or the collective. These can work to provide insurance, health care and health insurance&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:12&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:12&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and law enforcement&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:13&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:13&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and banking&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:14&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:14&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-property&quot;&gt;4. Property&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Devaluation reigns&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;And fear of self destruction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Adapt or be replaced&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;And follow their instructions…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;So lay waste to all we’ve made&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;For your corporate palisade…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;41-property-as-a-guarantor-and-extension-of-autonomy&quot;&gt;4.1. Property As a Guarantor and Extension of Autonomy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although most forms of anarchism are hostile to property, I view it as a crucial guarantor of individual autonomy. Without the ability to own things, both to support one’s own life, such as food and shelter, and to allow for the ongoing support of one’s life, in the means of production, the individual is placed at the mercy of the collective. This can be formalized, as it is in some forms of anarcho-communism and in all forms of authoritarian communism, where the means of production are officially owned by the community, and so each individual is in the end subordinated to one community or another, unable to separate themselves from groups. This can also be informal: if anyone can take from you your means of survival and production at any time, for any reason, whenever they feel like it, you are just as at the mercy of everyone else as if it was formalized, just in a different way. You have no sphere to plan and act according to your own will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not just necessary to have the &lt;em&gt;ability&lt;/em&gt; to own property for use that is important to individual autonomy, however: it is the actual state of owning such property that is equally important. One’s actual autonomy expands and contracts in conjunction with the amount of property one is able to use. Someone who has the ability, technically, to own the means of production necessary to their own work is still not free if someone else owns the tools they use; their labor time is still subject to the commands of the capitalist, and the products of their labor still forfeit. Therefore, a too-strict adherence to private property in the Lockean sense still leads to the subordination of individual autonomy to the will of others, just as in communism or collectivism; the only difference is that instead of being subject to the community’s will, and thereby at least having some say (in anarcho-communism anyway), the worker has no say whatsoever but to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is crucial to note, in the course of this argument, that the function of property for the individual as a guarantor of individual autonomy hinges on &lt;em&gt;use and occupation&lt;/em&gt;. Property does not enhance the autonomy of an individual that never uses that property — in that sense it is completely neutral to them. Therefore, at least under this first understanding, there is no reason to respect someone’s property if they are not actually using or occupying it; if you cease to respect their absentee property, they will cease to respect yours, but no great amount of autonomy of your own will be lost in that, and much will be gained by no longer being subject to the commands from afar of capitalists and landlords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Property is also an extension of autonomy in another way, however. It represents &lt;em&gt;stored&lt;/em&gt; labor time. To take away someone’s property is to make it so that all the time they spent working to produce or buy that property was not actually spent for their own purposes, in service of their own plan for life, both then and in the future, but instead was spent laboring in service of your plans. Suddenly they were laboring under your command, for your purposes, in negation of their own will. The theft of property is therefore a violation of someone’s past autonomy. This is not as serious an offense as the violation of someone’s future or current autonomy, through direct coercion or the protection of property which allows you to hold dominion over them, but it is still a violation which has some serious impact, and is therefore a breach of reciprocation in an important sense. This must be considered even when seizing absentee property, although it may not weigh particularly heavily on the decision-making of an egoist adhering to my framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, property is both a guarantor of, and an extension of, individual autonomy. At the same time, property is &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; that, not a substitute for it. Elevating respect for and protection of private property to the top of one’s hierarchy of values is to serve an abstract ideal. This might seem like the right thing to do, but that is only because some of one’s own self-interest in generally protecting property has been invested into that ideal, and you are serving that component of your self-interest to the detriment of the others, and poorly as well. To do that is to make yourself a slave to something that is not representative of your full interests, and therefore is just as problematic as elevating god, altruism, the collective, the state, tradition, or a specific master over oneself. In light of this truth, the wise egoist must not make the same mistake that propertarians (right-libertarians and anarcho-capitalists) make by substituting true freedom for the freedom to dispose of property (externally or in one’s own person) how one pleases. There is more to freedom than that, even if that represents, and protects, some important components of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;42-absentee-property-eg-land-and-capital&quot;&gt;4.2. Absentee Property (e.g. Land and Capital)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this second conception of property, which is admittedly similar in many respects to the Lockean or Nozickean conception of property, it is important to clarify a key difference between the account of property in a reciprocal ethic, and the account of property in a side-constraints or natural rights ethic. In a side-constraints or natural rights ethic, property must be respected at all costs, and only in terms of its extension in labor, not the consequential extension the possession of property brings to people in having a free sphere for action. This is not the case in my ethic. If the possession of certain property is doing greater damage to the autonomy of an individual or group of individuals than violating positive passive reciprocity in this case would bring by making others (and the community as a whole) less likely to respect those individual’s own property, then it is in fact in their interest to cease respecting that person’s autonomy as expressed in that property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a tricky calculation: one the one hand, we have a great subordination and loss of autonomy because of the possession of some property by some person. On the other hand, we have an uncertain chance of another amount of autonomy being lost if the individuals harmed, or the community at large, stopped respecting autonomy in property to one degree or another, as a result of the individuals subordinated ceasing to respect the property being used against them. In most cases, the subordination to others that takes place because of property is not onerous enough to justify this: for instance, having to work in order to trade for what one needs in life is a small price to pay for security in the product of one’s labor and a sphere in which one is safe to act as one pleases. I could certainly try to live for free off the produce of others, but soon they would cease to respect my autonomy, or my ability to possess things, and I would quickly lose &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;. Furthermore, in most cases, disrespecting other’s property disrespects their direct autonomy as represented in the first aspect in which property means autonomy, as well as indirectly in because of the labor time stolen. Both of these together are a very powerful investment of autonomy into something, and so to stop respecting property in which both of these things are invested is a very great violation of passive positive reciprocity and would be greeted as such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of &lt;em&gt;absentee&lt;/em&gt; property, conversely, the story is different. Absentee property, through extortion, rent, or profit, can exact huge losses of autonomy on people, as the loss of something intimately necessary to their ability to labor, live, etc. is threatened in order to get them to subordinate themselves to another’s authority docilely. On the other hand, the loss of absentee property causes no loss of autonomy in the first sense in which property is invested with it on the part of the absentee owner, as they were never using that property to begin with, nor was it something they were relying on to maintain their autonomy or free sphere of action. There is a loss of autonomy as represented in the past labor time invested into the property by the absentee owner, but with the benefit in alleviating subjugation, the direct gain in gaining new property to labor on and govern oneself with, and without the added direct loss of autonomy in the first respect, as well as the fact that others besides the owner of the property may not choose to even involve themselves in negative reciprocation, it should be clear that in most cases respect in absentee property should be hard to come by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not that absentee property should not be totally disrespected in all cases; controlling the product of one’s labor is very important to an individual’s autonomy, and thus the respect of someone’s labor time as it is invested in objects is too. A society that constantly, lightheartedly, and frivolously violated property rights, even in absentee property, undercuts half of the reason anyone respects anyone else’s property at all, and endangers itself. Thus, property that is owned by a person who does not regularly use it, but which is neither needed by others, nor regularly used by others who are dominated by its owner, can and should be respected as a general principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;43-abandonment&quot;&gt;4.3. Abandonment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another exception to the rule of respecting private property on the basis of the invested labor time of the original owner is in the case when the thief, having held the property for some amount of time, has actually invested more labor into it than the original owner did, in either repairs, upkeep, or improvements. In such a case, to return the property to the original owner would be a greater disrespect of the autonomy of the thief than the thief’s original theft was of the owner’s autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is not a hard-and-fast rule, as proportionality is more in the eyes of the beholders than it is an objective rational science, but it would still produce a tendency for property to stay with the person who has worked on it more. Additionally, such cases are usually only going to arise in the case of property that was either clearly abandoned, or absentee to begin with, with the original owner swooping in at some later date in order to reclaim something they never cared about before. That means that people are even less likely to care about respecting their original claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;44-the-defense-of-property&quot;&gt;4.4. The Defense of Property&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must note here that one is not simply justified in using any means necessary to protect one’s property, but instead must use methods to protect it that are proportional to what the violator did. For example, if someone enters my house, I cannot begin by shooting them. I must ask them to leave, try to guide them out by the arm, and only when they start resisting my attempts by attacking me, may I engage with them in self-defense while also trying to move them out of my house. However, preventing someone from entering my house in the first place is not an attack on their autonomy, as they had no right to be there in the first place, nor is preventing someone from entering some space, as I have just as much right to stand in a certain spot (even if it happens to be at the entrance of some place they desire to go) as they do, and if they attack me to move me out of the way, that is &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; fault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, all the direct and known-beforehand consequences of actions taken in the name of negative reciprocity count as part of their consequences, and therefore must be counted when it comes to whether they are proportional or not.  Thus, kicking someone off of my property and hence directly off the edge of a cliff, forever, does not merely count (as naive right-libertarians imagine) as kicking them off my property, but also counts as killing them when they reach the bottom of that cliff. This does not include consequences of actions taken in defense of my autonomy that are merely the continuation of something that would have happened otherwise, where the violation of my autonomy which I am undoing is merely a suspension of what would have happened had that violation of my autonomy not occurred at all. For instance, if someone is dying, and they hook themselves up to me in order to use my body to survive, when I unhook them, I am defending my autonomy, but as a direct result of my action they are now dying again. This, however, is not my fault, since they were already dying before they interacted with me or I with them, and my action was merely removing an unjustly acquired suspension of an already-occurring process from their grasp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;51-contracts&quot;&gt;5.1. Contracts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a myriad of forms which the hierarchies of authority which sap individual autonomy may take. One is force, another is dependence  (typically through claims on absentee property), and a third, less often discussed, is &lt;em&gt;contract&lt;/em&gt;. Under the traditional conceptions of contracts seen throughout society and often preserved in right-libertarian writing, a contract is essentially a promise that is legally, or ethically, enforceable. Therefore, whatever each side of the contract promises to do or provide can be compelled from them if the other side of the contract performs their end of the bargain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has clearly authoritarian and oppressive implications. On a conceptual level, each person is in some sense the same individual as they were when they originally made a contract, but in some sense crucially relevant to autonomy, they are not. They are a different, similar person, and to be indefinitely and implacably bound to the promises and statements they have made in the past is its own special kind of odious bondage. If I promise to do something, but later realize that it was a poorly thought out idea and no longer want to participate in whatever I promised to do, it is fundamentally an extreme abridgment of my ability to rationally plan my own course in life and choose my actions, as well as my ability to control how my time (and labor) is spent, and with whom, to compel me by force to adhere to my promise. After all, when I, in passive positive cooperation, respect the autonomy of others, no positive action is required of me, and no encroachment is made into the sphere within which my autonomy exists. My absolute freedom is abridged, perhaps, but only slightly, and in return, a much more relevant freedom is ensured. And there is nothing on the other side of this equation: if I refuse to adhere to a contract, &lt;em&gt;no one’s autonomy is abridged!&lt;/em&gt; People are disappointed, certainly, and they may choose not to interact or trade with me in the future because they do not view me as trustworthy, but I &lt;em&gt;have not broken passive positive reciprocation whatsoever&lt;/em&gt;. Therefore, the only motivation one has to keep contracts is the social motivation of wanting to be viewed as trustworthy and wanting to engage in positive active reciprocation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will still be a need for the actual paper and language of contracts to some degree in a world of reciprocal ethics, however. After all, in the social realm, it is still useful to have a record of the promises one has made and the conditions under which everyone agreed to consider them fulfilled, in order to have some way of settling disputes concerning allegedly broken promises and betrayed trust, so that those involved do not get their reputations destroyed unfairly or unnecessarily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about when there is mutual consideration involved in contracts, however? In that case, if one side does not uphold their side of the contract, but receives and takes the property of the other, the conditions under which the other side agreed to consider that property a product of the invested labor time of the other party do not hold, and so that other party is currently holding stolen property, which is a violation of the autonomy of the other party, and the property should be returned. Likewise, if the cheated party did labor for the other party, again their autonomy was abridged, as they were forced to use their bodies and time in a way that they would not have if they had known the truth of the outcome; however, labor is an immaterial, ethereal thing which disperses into objects and representations, and therefore, a direct return of that labor may be impossible. If it was invested into a particular object which was then to be transferred to the cheating party, that object becomes the property of the person who labored on it, as one example of how that limitation might be evaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In repossessing stolen property, it is important to remember that if damage is down to the thief in excess of the damage done by the theft, and the subsequent defense of that theft if applicable, it should probably be repaid in some way. This is likely to be ensured if both sides are interested, as they should be, in re-establishing positive and cooperative relations, and if both sides have mutual defense or insurance associations representing their interests, as they probably would, both side’s interests are likely to be represented, although in clear-cut cases, it will be fairly easy to discern who violated reciprocity — which all parties view it as in their interest to preserve — and so those representing that side will be less likely to defend them because they don’t want it to be common for those who violate reciprocity to get away with it easily, as that is not beneficial to them either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of all this, a new picture of contracts emerges under this ethic: one where contracts can be voided at any time, for only the return of any transferred property or labor to their original owners if possible. This respects the choices and autonomy of all involved in my view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;52-sale&quot;&gt;5.2. Sale&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the incompatibility of being forcefully held to one’s promises and individual autonomy itself, what about sale? It would seem, since sale is simply the promise of an item to another person, that the seller could simply repossess their sold property at any time. This is actually incorrect, however: when someone transfers some property to another, they are not giving up the freedom or autonomy of their future selves at all. On the contrary, they are merely stating in that moment that the labor time that they invested in that object was done ultimately for the gain of that other person, and thereby disavowing a connection with that labor time. Once the connection is broken, it is no longer considered a part of their sphere of free action, their autonomy. Instead, the labor time the buyer invested in whatever they traded for the property is now invested in that property, as they &lt;em&gt;had to invest that labor time&lt;/em&gt; in order to receive that property and so, by analogy, that labor time is invested &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; the property. Furthermore, it becomes part of their sphere of autonomous action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;53-coercion-and-consent&quot;&gt;5.3. Coercion and Consent&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One crucial component of any contract, or any other interaction for that matter, is consent. Without consent, one party is merely subjugating and dominating the other party, abridging their autonomy and breaking the positive reciprocation of cooperation. Acting on someone without their consent is in fact the &lt;em&gt;primary&lt;/em&gt; example of disrespecting someone else’s autonomy, because when you do so, you are choosing for them — either directly, through non-consensual physical invasion — or indirectly — through extortion or other means — what happens to their body, time, and life, without consulting them as to whether it is part of their free plan for life, a choice of their own that is a product of their thinking mind. Furthermore, if someone does not clearly know the consequences of agreeing to some interaction, and the commitments that would entail, engaging in that interaction is just as clearly a violation of their autonomy as engaging in an interaction they actively reject. After all, if they do not know the consequences of what they are agreeing to, how can they actually have chosen what will result from that interaction?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What constitutes consent and coercion, exactly, though? Technically speaking, it could be said that any action is ‘consensual’ if the other party is not specifically imposing consequences that, but for their choice to do so, would not be present, and which constitute direct invasions of someone’s body or property completely absent any choice on their part. This is the definition of consent/coercion that is most directly hinted at by the analysis above. This is the simplistic definition of consent: if there is no one holding a gun to your head, or someone else’s head, or threatening to steal something, etc., then the action is consensual and does not constitute an abridgment of autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As should be clear from how I have been using the concept of disrespecting (or abridging) autonomy up until now, however, consent is not an obviously binary thing. The simplistic picture is an incomplete analysis. An interaction which is technically ‘voluntary,’ in that it does not constitute a direct violation of person or property, or threat thereof, can still remove much autonomy, much ability to choose what to do with oneself and one’s time, labor, etc., without being strictly coercive in the simplistic sense. This can happen when someone is faced with options that in themselves represent enough of a loss of autonomy that it seems that to preserve what autonomy they have, they must choose from a far more restricted set of options. Once the stage is set like this, the person is left open to those who control the restricted set of options to use their advantage to control the choices, time, and labor of those with restricted options to almost as great a degree as the other options themselves. Thus, if my choices are starvation, suicide, and working for someone, they can, if they so choose, push the loss of autonomy of working for them all the way up to the point where it is just barely better than starvation or death. If they do so, it is unclear how this choice to work for them, and the life under them, can be termed free, consensual, or voluntary without being nearly farcical. There is no autonomy to be found in the other two choices, and nearly none in the final choice taken; as such, squeezing the autonomy out of the only choice that has some of it at all should clearly be recognized as an abridgment  of autonomy. Not as great as the simplistic version of coercion, perhaps, and depending on the amount of autonomy left in the unpleasant options and the amount squeezed out of the main option, the greatness of the coercion can vary, but nevertheless, using a superior position to do such things represents a violation of positive cooperation in respect for autonomy to some degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conjunction with my arguments in section for with regard to absentee property, this understanding of consent as representing the amount of autonomy left in all the options one has open to one, and violations of consent being perpetrated by those who control the amount of autonomy represented in certain options, present a powerful argument against collectivism, but also capitalism, workplace harassment, and more. This is also what justifies the definition of consent as needing to be ongoing and enthusiastic: if consent is actually positively withdrawn, then to continue is a violation of autonomy no matter what; if consent is not enthusiastic, then there is probably a limiting of autonomy going on, which in turn is probably a violation of the reciprocal order, which might need more or less of a response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How should this response be carried out? Because consent is more of a gradient than a binary switch, and the degree to which consent is given — and therefore the severity of the reciprocal response required, if any, from either the person involved or the community as a means of protecting each other — any response is going to be inescapably subjective. It is not possible to require (or enforce) a single, legitimate, ‘correct’ decision regarding of coercion has taken place or not. As such, each person will have to react to an interaction that may or may not be consensual by their own lights, defending the person being taken advantage of, or not, to some degree or another, as they best see fit. Each person’s actions and commitment to their opinions concerning the matter will be judged against the others by the action of market forces and the interactions of the reciprocal order, with people who react truly out of line themselves violating the reciprocal order and being brought back down to earth. Thus, a system of ‘enforcement’ of consent will develop through a stigmergic process, instead of enforcing a single consent standard that might, on the one hand, be too lenient, or on the other hand, bar someone from making a bargain that, while an abridgment of their autonomy, is simply the best option available. Without a centralized system enforcing a single ‘legitimate’ rule concerning what counts as consent or not exceptions can be made for particular situations as needed by those best in a situation to know what is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To establish a base level of ability to consent, maturing people could perhaps be presented with a rite of passage, or a psychological evaluation that results in a score or set of scores, on the basis of which each member of the community could judge whether the person is generally — when in their right mind, etc — able to consent to interactions, and react to that person and those who interact with &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; accordingly. It would be important that there be no specific ‘pass’ or ‘fail’ state to such a test, but instead a score that accurately represents some capacity, so that the decision is made available for all to judge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;54-just-price&quot;&gt;5.4. Just Price&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also perhaps the seeds of a ‘just theory of price’ here: if the price, represented in property, demanded by a seller far exceeds (in invested labor time) the amount of labor time actually invested in the object, then it could be the case that this person is not respecting the autonomy of the other person, as represented by their labor time, as much as their own. This is not a total violation of positive reciprocal cooperation, but it is something important to consider, and may or may not constitute something that requires correction. This is especially true in the case when the amount of labor time (and invested autonomy) required for the use of property is designed to be indefinite and limitless, such as in the case of rent, profit, or interest: in those cases, we have someone demanding near limitless concessions of autonomy in return for a small concession of autonomy on their part. In this specific case, the limit of any number over a number tending towards infinity is zero, and so it could be said that the landlord, capitalist, or banker, in asking for these infinite rents, has no respect for the autonomy of others. Therefore, in this particular case of unequal price, it is not only an unequal respect for autonomy, which might be dealt with but might not (depending on the circumstances), but a complete violation of reciprocity, which should probably be met with some response. Note that this only applies to people charging a continuous price for a singular item which they invested a finite amount of labor time into in the past; if it is an ongoing service, then it is fair to ask an ongoing price for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is crucially different than the Marxist labor theory of value because it does not specify absolutely that any unequal price, when calculated in labor time, is exploitation on the part of one person or another, nor that every exchange must take place between things that the same amounts of labor have gone into. I do not reject the marginalist viewpoint on the origins and nature of value and price on the market. Instead, this is merely to set boundaries on price. As long as prices are roughly sensible, no one will have an issue, even if they are fairly unequal in invested labor time. As long as the amount of effort and skill invested in something is recognized in the trade, it will be seen as acceptable cooperation; but if the amount given on one side is vastly out of proportion to the amount given on the other side, then cooperation will begin to break down dangerously.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:40&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:40&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a society of individuals committed to autonomy and an ethic of reciprocity, it is impossible to dictate, plan, or predict what the specific modes of organization and solutions to problems would be. To expect an individualist anarchist to give a precise account of what life post-state and post-capitalism &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; look like is like asking someone to predict the next invention on the market, or the next philosophy that would be produced, or any number of the other things that are the product of the creativity of individuals, acting alone or in concert. It is simply an impossible task, and a task that no one should &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to do: freeing up individuals to use their own reason and their own ideas in their organization with others and attempts to figure out how to live with others is the entire point of anarchy, and the fact that so many more creative and individual minds will be set to the task, and so many more new solutions tried, is one of the many benefits. Therefore, not only can I not offer a picture of what an individualist anarchist ‘society’ would look like, I refuse to! However, I can offer some ideas about what I think will be most likely, and some ways things &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; work. Keep in mind, all the more, however, that these are merely ideas, not plans or prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individuals committed to the ethic laid out herein would probably organize, insofar as they organize at all, in very different ways than individuals in our modern socioeconomic context do. First of all, in order to preserve their autonomy within the sphere of production, there would be a great preference for independent contracting: each individual producing what they think best to produce on their own, under no authority, with the means of production that they personally own and use, under the guidance of no one but themselves.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:carson&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:carson&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This ideal is increasingly possible, as the means to manufacture everything (both physical and non-physical) become smaller and cheaper; we can see the seeds of this in the DIY and ‘maker’ communities, as well as in the world of software development. Kevin Carson gives a modern example of something like this in Italy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The closest existing model for sustainable manufacturing is  Emilia-Romagna. In that region of 4.2 million people, the most  prosperous in Italy, manufacturing centers on “flexible manufacturing  networks” of small-scale firms, rather than enormous factories  or vertically integrated corporations. Small-scale, general-purpose  machinery is integrated into craft production, and frequently switches  between different product lines. It follows a lean production model  geared to demand, with production taking place only to fill orders, so  there’s no significant inventory cost. Supply chains are mostly local,  as is the market. The local economy is not prone to the same boom-bust  cycle which results from overproduction to keep unit costs down, without regard to demand. Although a significant share of Emilia-Romagna’s  output goes to the export market, its industry would suffer far less  dislocation from a collapse of the global economy than its counterparts  in the United States; given the small scale of production and the short  local supply chains, a shift to production primarily for local needs  would be relatively uncomplicated. The region’s average wage is about  double that of Italy for a whole, and some 45% of its GDP comes from  cooperatively owned enterprises.[2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Emilia-Romagna’s production model is a fulfillment of the potential  of electrically powered machinery. The decentralizing potential of  small-scale, electrically powered machinery was a central theme of  Kropotkin’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://c4ss.org/content/25051&quot;&gt;Fields, Factories and Workshops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. With electricity “distributed in the houses for bringing into motion  small motors of from one-quarter to twelve horse-power,” workers were  able to leave the small workshops to work in their houses.[3] More  important, by freeing machinery up from a single prime mover, it ended  all limits on where the small workshops themselves could be located. The primary basis for economy of scale, as it existed in the nineteenth  century, was the need to economize on horsepower — a justification that  vanished when the distribution of electrical power eliminated reliance  on a single source of power.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:45&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:45&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This revolution in radically distributed production techniques will only become more possible without a patent monopoly limiting competition dramatically (especially in preventing individuals from producing patented goods) and enforcing cartelization. As Carson says in a different essay,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Without intellectual property, in any industry where the basic  production equipment is widely affordable, and bottom-up networking  renders management obsolete, it is likely that self-managed, cooperative production will replace the old managerial hierarchies. The network  revolution, if its full potential is realized (as James Bennett put it  in the appropriately titled article “The End of Capitalism and the  Triumph of the Market Economy”), will lead to substantial redistribution of power and money from the twentieth-century industrial producers of  information, culture, and communications–like Hollywood, the recording  industry, and perhaps the broadcasters and some of the  telecommunications giants–to a combination of widely diffuse populations around the globe and the market actors that will build the tools that  make this population better able to produce its own information  environment rather than buying it ready-made.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:19&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:19&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, this model of highly networked and decentralized demand-focused production based on general-purpose manufacturing tools, managed by individuals without the need for huge corporate hierarchies, is far more efficient in the world of 21st century technology than the old corporate model is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But the corporate framework is itself unsustainable. The  proliferation of even more productive small-scale machinery, like  desktop digitally-controlled machine tools, combined with the unenforceability of “intellectual property” law in the digital age,  and combined as well with new ways for ordinary people to pool dispersed capital, are leading to a singularity that will tear down the corporate walls. The separate terminal crises of corporate capitalism are  reinforcing each other to create a perfect storm: the corporate  economy’s need for subsidized inputs continues to grow exponentially,  even as the collapse of the rents on intellectual property causes the  base of taxable value to implode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So long as the state successfully manages to prop up the centralized  corporate economic order, libertarian and decentralist technologies and  organizational forms will be incorporated into the old corporate  framework. As the system approaches its limits of sustainability, those  elements become increasingly destabilizing forces within the  present system, and prefigure the successor system. When the system  finally reaches that limit, those elements will (to paraphrase Marx)  break out of their state capitalist integument and become the building  blocks of a fundamentally different free market society…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Peer production and the open source model were originally developed  in the immaterial realm, leading to the stresses on the culture industry described earlier. But as technology for physical production becomes  feasible on increasingly smaller scales and at less cost, and as the  transaction costs for pooling many dispersed small-scale capitals for a  single venture approach zero, there is less and less disconnect between  the respective applications of peer production principle in the  immaterial and physical realms. In effect, the distinction between  Richard Stallman’s “free speech” and “free beer” is eroding in the realm of physical production. Michel Bauwens writes:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;P2P can arise not only in the immaterial sphere of intellectual and  software production, but wherever there is access to distributed  technology: spare computing cycles, distributed telecommunications and  any kind of viral communicator meshwork.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;P2P can arise wherever other forms of distributed fixed capital are  available: such is the case for carpooling, which is the second most  used mode of transportation in the U.S….&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;P2P can arise wherever financial capital can be distributed.  Initiatives such as the ZOPA bank point in that direction. Cooperative  purchase and use of large capital goods are a possibility.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:44:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:44&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These independent producers would trade with each other for parts or whatever else they need to produce a finished project at their stage of production, and perhaps create contract agreements to buy certain amounts at certain prices with each other, but such contracts are of course not enforceable and so the network of independent producers would be fundamentally fluid, responding rapidly to the demands of the market and the abilities of individuals, as a peer-to-peer, distributed economy. This would be further facilitated by just-in-time manufacturing techniques, and further advantaged in competition with large centralized corporations (or cooperatives) by the fact that transportation and centralization would no longer be subsidized by a State. These fluid ‘mesh networks’ of producers would also be far more efficient and responsive to market conditions, and lacking all of the knowledge and calculation problems inherent in centralized, non-market modes of production. This would make the economy far less likely to experience boom-bust cycles, as it can more rapidly respond to demand shocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insofar as it is impossible to break some process of production down into sections that can be performed by individuals or very small groups in a reasonable manner that is not overcome by transaction costs, individuals will need to form organizations to produce certain things. It is my opinion that worker cooperatives of one type or another will be preferred for this task. Worker cooperatives are a superior organizational form to corporations for many reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, it is easier for worker cooperatives to hire workers. They present a far better offer: one in which the profits of working for the cooperative are directly placed in the hands of the workers, instead of the workers having to depend on the caprices, poor knowledge, and adverse incentives of bosses in order to get a reward; in which the each worker is subject to far less arbitrary authority and hierarchy, and indeed retains some control over their workplace, through being a partial owner of the whole business; and one in which, because of that partial ownership, each worker enjoys far greater job security and stability, as well as the hope of decreased hours across the board and stabilized pay in the face of automation, instead of (sometimes) increased pay for some and unemployment for others. To quote Bertrand Russel:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is the morality of the Slave State, applied in circumstances  totally unlike those in which it arose. No wonder the result has been  disastrous. Let us take an illustration. Suppose that, at a given  moment, a certain number of people are engaged in the manufacture of  pins. They make as many pins as the world needs, working (say) eight  hours a day. Someone makes an invention by which the same number of men  can make twice as many pins: pins are already so cheap that hardly any  more will be bought at a lower price. In a sensible world, everybody  concerned in the manufacturing of pins would take to working four hours  instead of eight, and everything else would go on as before. But in the  actual world this would be thought demoralizing. The men still work  eight hours, there are too many pins, some employers go bankrupt, and  half the men previously concerned in making pins are thrown out of work. There is, in the end, just as much leisure as on the other plan, but  half the men are totally idle while half are still overworked. In this  way, it is insured that the unavoidable leisure shall cause misery all  round instead of being a universal source of happiness. Can anything  more insane be imagined?&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:48&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:48&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second of all, worker cooperatives are also likely to be more efficient, as they do not suffer as severely from worker incentive problems, principal-agent problems, knowledge problems, and calculation problems. To quote once more from Carson, on the subject of knowledge, incentive, and agency problems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In an article in last June’s &lt;em&gt;Freeman&lt;/em&gt;, I applied some ideas  from the socialist-calculation debate to the private corporation and  examined the extent to which it is an island of calculational chaos in  the market economy. I’d like to expand that line of analysis now and  apply some common free-market insights on knowledge and incentives to  the operation of the corporate hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;F. A. Hayek, in “The Use of Knowledge in Society,” used distributed,  or idiosyncratic, knowledge — the unique situational knowledge possessed by each individual — as an argument against state central planning.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Milton Friedman’s dictum about “other people’s money” is well known.  People are more careful and efficient in spending their own than other  people’s money, and likewise in spending money on themselves more so  than in spending money on other people.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A third insight is that people act most efficiently when they  completely internalize the positive and negative results of their  actions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The corporate hierarchy violates all of these principles in a manner  quite similar to the bureaucracy of a socialist state. Those at the top  make decisions concerning a production process about which they likely  know as little as did, say, the chief of an old Soviet industrial  ministry.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The employees of a corporation, from the CEO down to the worker on  the shop floor, are spending other people’s money, or using other  people’s resources, for other people. Its managers, as Adam Smith  observed 200 years ago, are “managers rather of other people’s money  than of their own.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;By its nature, the corporation substitutes administrative incentives  for what Oliver Williamson called the “high powered incentives” of the  market: effort and productivity are separated from reward. As Ronald  Coase observed some 70 years ago,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If a workman moves from department Y to  department X, he does not go because of a change in relative prices, but because he is ordered to do so. …&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It can, I think, be assumed that the distinguishing mark of the firm is the supersession of the price mechanism.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:15&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:15&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerning the calculation problems inherent in the corporate form, he says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This calculation argument can be applied not only to a state-planned  economy, but also to the internal planning of the large corporation  under interventionism, or state capitalism. (By state capitalism, I  refer to the means by which, as Murray Rothbard said, “our corporate  state uses the coercive taxing power either to accumulate corporate  capital or to lower corporate costs,” in addition to cartelizing markets through regulations, enforcing artificial property rights like  “intellectual property,” and otherwise protecting privilege against  competition.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Rothbard developed the economic calculation argument in just this  way. He argued that the further removed the internal transfer pricing of a corporation became from real market prices, the more internal  allocation of resources was characterized by calculational chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mises’s calculation argument can be applied to the large  corporation—both under state capitalism and to some extent in the free  market—in another way not considered by Rothbard. The basic cause of  calculational chaos, as Mises understood it, was the separation of  entrepreneurial from technical knowledge and the attempt to make  production decisions based on technical considerations alone, without  regard to such entrepreneurial considerations as factor pricing. But the principle also works the other way: production decisions based solely  on input and product prices, without regard to the details of production (the typical MBA practice of considering only finance and marketing,  while treating the production process as a black box), also result in calculational chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The chief focus of this article, however, is Mises’s calculation  argument in the light of distributed information. F. A. Hayek, in “The  Uses of Knowledge in Society,” raised a new problem: not the generation  or source of data, but the sheer volume of data to be processed. In so  doing, he is commonly understood to have opened a second front in  Mises’s war against state planning. But in fact his argument was almost  as damaging to Mises as to the collectivists.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mises minimized the importance of distributed information in his own  criticisms of state planning. He denied any correlation between  bureaucratization and large size in themselves. Bureaucracy as such was a particular rules-based approach to policy-making, in contrast to the  profit-driven behavior of the entrepreneur. The private firm, therefore, was by definition exempt from the problem of bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In so arguing, he ignored the information and coordination problems  inherent in large size. The large corporation necessarily distributes  the knowledge relevant to informed entrepreneurial decisions among many  departments and sub-departments until the cost of aggregating that  knowledge outweighs the benefits of doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Try as he might, Mises could not exempt the capitalist corporation  from the problem of bureaucracy. One cannot define bureaucracy out of  existence, or overcome the problem of distributed knowledge, simply by  using the word “entrepreneur.” Mises tried to make the bureaucratic or  non-bureaucratic character of an organization a simple matter of its  organizational goals rather than its functioning. The motivation of the  corporate employee, from the CEO down to the production worker, by  definition, will be profit-seeking; his will is in harmony with that of  the stockholder because he belongs to the stockholder’s organization.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;By defining organizational goals as “profit-seeking,” Mises—like the  neoclassicals—treated the internal workings of the organization as a  black box. In treating the internal policies of the capitalist  corporation as inherently profit-driven, Mises simultaneously treated  the entrepreneur as an indivisible actor whose will and perception  permeate the entire organization. Mises’s entrepreneur was a brooding  omnipresence, guiding the actions of every employee from CEO to janitor.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:16&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:16&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the worker cooperative remains a form of authority and hierarchy, just a less severe and despotic one than corporations and bossism: after all, one is subordinated to the collective vote of the other workers. One has some say in it, at least, and at least everyone who is in control is at the same level of the organization as those who are controlled and are therefore subject to whatever rules they make for themselves, but nevertheless democracy is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; perfect individual freedom, whatever the communists will tell you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not deny that corporations may exist, either, but I suspect they will be greatly reduced in power when worker cooperatives are free to compete with them; right now, under the current state capitalist system, there are very many subsidies, monopolies, and privileges that corporations and the wealthy have received, and continue to receive, from the system which do not stem from free market forces.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:15:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:15&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:18&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:18&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:19:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:19&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:20&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:20&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:22&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:22&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:23&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:23&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;32&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; To quote Roderick Long:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Corporations tend to fear competition, because competition exerts  downward pressure on prices and upward pressure on salaries; moreover,  success on the market comes with no guarantee of permanency, depending  as it does on outdoing other firms at correctly figuring out how best to satisfy forever-changing consumer preferences, and that kind of  vulnerability to loss is no picnic. It is no surprise, then, that  throughout U.S. history corporations have been overwhelmingly hostile to the free market. Indeed, most of the existing regulatory  apparatus—including those regulations widely misperceived as restraints  on corporate power—were vigorously supported, lobbied for, and in some  cases even drafted by the corporate elite.[1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Corporate power depends crucially on government intervention in the  marketplace.[2] This is obvious enough in the case of the more overt  forms of government favoritism such as subsidies, bailouts,[3] and other forms of corporate welfare; protectionist tariffs; explicit grants of  monopoly privilege; and the seizing of private property for corporate  use via eminent domain (as in &lt;em&gt;Kelo v. New London&lt;/em&gt;). But these  direct forms of pro-business intervention are supplemented by a swarm of indirect forms whose impact is arguably greater still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As I have written elsewhere:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One especially useful service that the state can render  the corporate elite is cartel enforcement. Price-fixing agreements are  unstable on a free market, since while all parties to the agreement have a collective interest in seeing the agreement generally hold, each has  an individual interest in breaking the agreement by underselling the  other parties in order to win away their customers; and even if the  cartel manages to maintain discipline over its own membership, the  oligopolistic prices tend to attract new competitors into the market.  Hence the advantage to business of state-enforced cartelisation. Often  this is done directly, but there are indirect ways too, such as imposing uniform quality standards that relieve firms from having to compete in  quality. (And when the quality standards are high, lower-quality but  cheaper competitors are priced out of the market.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ability of colossal firms to exploit economies of scale is also  limited in a free market, since beyond a certain point the benefits of  size (e.g., reduced transaction costs) get outweighed by &lt;em&gt;dis&lt;/em&gt;economies of scale (e.g., calculational chaos stemming from absence of price feedback)—&lt;em&gt;unless&lt;/em&gt; the state enables them to socialise these costs by immunising them from competition – e.g., by imposing fees, licensure requirements,  capitalisation requirements, and other regulatory burdens that  disproportionately impact newer, poorer entrants as opposed to richer,  more established firms.[4] &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:17&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:17&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, it’s not even clear if the corporation, at it exists under modern state capitalism, is even a free market institution at all:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A corporation that is compatible with natural law is no more than an  association of natural persons, who agree to recognize the association  as an artificial person “in its own right.” However, as far as other  persons are concerned, the existence of the association and its recognition by the partners as an independent artificial person in no way diminish the responsibility or the liability of the partners. How the partners assign responsibilities and liabilities among themselves is their business, but they lawfully cannot agree to deflect them to the artificial corporate person that they created. The partners own the corporation, and, as owners, they are fully responsible and liable for what “it” does. I cannot give lawful personality to my dog or my car and tell others that, when an accident happens, they should sue the dog or  the car and leave me alone. In natural law, a corporation is just as  much a means of human action as a dog, a car, or any other tool might  be.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The privilege of “legal personality,” however, consists precisely in  the dilution of the responsibilities and liabilities of ownership. For  those who receive the privilege, it is both an immunity and an  empowerment. For others, the privilege is a dilution of their  respectable rights.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:21&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:21&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also think that the economy will be much more focused on local business. Not only is size itself probably more of a disadvantage than an advantage without the state to protect large corporations from competition, large scale combined with large spacial distribution is even more of a problem: if diseconomies of scale do not overwhelm global and national corporations by default, being forced to pay the full costs of long distance transportation probably will. On the free market advantage or disadvantage is not a matter of absolute costs, so even if transportation is cheaper and more efficient on the free market, if those who actually &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; long distance transportation are forced to bear the full cost of doing so (in maintaining roads, etc), instead of being able to share the costs with everyone else through the tax system, they are relatively worse off in comparison to local businesses that don’t have to pay for long distance transportation, in comparison to the balance under the state. This means that we could expect a shift towards local businesses on a free market, although maybe not the total elimination of non-local businesses. To quote Roderick Long (from the same article) again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Vast corporate empires like Wal-Mart are often either hailed or  condemned (depending on the speaker’s perspective) as products of the  free market. But not only is Wal-Mart a direct beneficiary of (usually  local) government intervention in the form of such measures as eminent  domain and tax breaks, but it also reaps less obvious benefits from  policies of wider application. The funding of public highways through  tax revenues, for example, constitutes a &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt;  transportation subsidy, allowing Wal-Mart and similar chains to  socialize the costs of shipping and so enabling them to compete more  successfully against local businesses; the low prices we enjoy at  Wal-Mart in our capacity as consumers are thus made possible in part by  our having already indirectly subsidized Wal-Mart’s operating costs in  our capacity as taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, under a free market, labor unions would be far more free to equalize the bargaining power between corporations and their workers. The corporate state has currently taken firm control over unions, turning them into a sort of ‘controlled opposition’ party and fostering conservatism and minimal demands. To quote Charles Johnson:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Too many of my comrades on the Left fall into the trap of taking the  Labor Day version of history for granted: modern unions are trumpeted as the main channel for the voice of workers; the institutionalization of  the system through the Wagner Act and the National Labor Relations Board in 1935, and the ensuing spike in union membership during the New Deal period, are regarded as one of the  great triumphs for workers of the past century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You may not be surprised to find out that I don’t find this picture of history &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; persuasive. The Wagner Act was the capstone of years of government promotion of conservative, AFL-line unions in order to subvert the organizing efforts of decentralized, uncompromising, radical unions such as the IWW and to avoid the previous year’s tumultuous general strikes in San  Francisco, Toledo, and Minneapolis. The labor movement as we know it today was created by government bureaucrats who effectively created a massive subsidy program for conservative unions which followed the AFL and CIO models of organizing — which emphatically did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; include general strikes or demands for worker ownership of firms. Once the NRLB-recognized unions had swept over the workforce and co-opted most of the movement  for organized labor, the second blow of the one-two punch fell:  government benefits always mean government strings attached, and in this case it was the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, which pulled the activities of the recognized unions firmly into  the regulatory grip of the federal government. Both the internal culture of post-Wagner mainstream unions, and the external controls of the  federal labor regulatory apparatus, have dramatically hamstrung the labor movement for the past half-century. Union methods are legally  restricted to collective bargaining and limited strikes (which &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; legally be expanded to secondary strikes, and which can be, and have been, broken by arbitrary fiat of the President). Union hiring halls are banned. Union resources have been systematically sapped by banning closed shop contracts, and encouraging states to ban union shop  contracts — thus forcing unions to represent free-riding employees who  do not join them and do not contribute dues. Union demands are  effectively constrained to modest (and easily revoked) improvements in  wages and conditions. And, since modern unions can do so little to  achieve their professed goals, and since their professed goals have been substantially lowered anyway, unionization of the workforce continues  its decades-long slide.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:25&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:25&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a free market, however, unions would once again be totally free to use all of the direct action and asymmetric warfare techniques that they used to get us the eight hour day and the five day work week:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Right-wing libertarians of the vulgar sort like to argue that unions  depend primarily on the threat of force, backed by the state, to exclude non-union workers… Without forcible exclusion of scabs, they say, strikes would almost always turn into lockouts and union defeats. Although this has acquired the status of dogma at Mises.Org, it’s nonsense on stilts. The primary reason for the  effectiveness of a strike is not the exclusion of scabs, but the transaction costs involved in hiring and training replacement workers, and the steep loss of productivity entailed in the disruption of human capital, institutional memory, and tacit knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With the strike organized in depth, with multiple lines of defense —  those sympathy and boycott strikes at every stage of production — the  cost and disruption have a multiplier effect far beyond that of a strike in a single plant. Under such conditions, even a large minority of  workers walking off the job at each stage of production can be quite  effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Taft-Hartley greatly reduced the effectiveness of strikes at individual  plants by prohibiting such coordination of actions across multiple  plants or industries. Taft-Hartley’s cooling off periods also gave  employers advance warning time to prepare for such disruptions, and  greatly reduced the informational rents embodied in the training of the  existing workforce. Were such restrictions on sympathy and boycott  strikes in suppliers [not] in place, today’s “just-in-time” economy  would likely be far more vulnerable to disruption than that of the  1930s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But long before Taft-Hartley, the labor law regime of the New Deal had  already created a fundamental shift in the form of labor struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Before Wagner and the NLRB-enforced collective bargaining process, labor struggle was less focused on strikes, and more focused on what workers  did in the workplace itself to exert leverage against management. They  focused, in other words, on what the Wobblies call “direct action on the job”; or in the colorful phrase of a British radical workers’ daily at  the turn of the century, “staying in on strike.” The reasoning was  explained in the Wobbly Pamphlet [PDF] “How to Fire Your Boss: A  Worker’s Guide to Direct Action“:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The bosses, with their large financial reserves, are better able to  withstand a long drawn-out strike than the workers. In many cases, court injunctions will freeze or confiscate the union’s strike funds. And  worst of all, a long walk-out only gives the boss a chance to replace  striking workers with a scab (replacement) workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Workers are far more effective when they take direct action while still  on the job. By deliberately reducing the boss’ profits while continuing  to collect wages, you can cripple the boss without giving some scab the  opportunity to take your job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Such tactics included slowdowns, sick-ins, random one-day walkouts at  unannounced intervals, working to rule, “good work” strikes, and “open  mouth sabotage.” Labor followed, in other words, a classic asymmetric  warfare model. Instead of playing by the enemy’s rules and suffering one honorable defeat after another, they played by their own rules and  mercilessly exploited the enemy’s weak points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The whole purpose of the Wagner regime was to put an end to this  asymmetric warfare model. As Thomas Ferguson and G. William Domhoff have both argued, corporate backing for the New Deal labor accord came  mainly from capital-intensive industry — the heart of the New Deal  coalition in general. Because of the complicated technical nature of  their production processes and their long planning horizons, their  management required long-term stability and predictability. At the same  time, because they were extremely capital-intensive, labor costs were a  relatively modest part of total costs. Management, therefore, was  willing to trade significant wage increases and job security for social  peace on the job. Wagner came about, not because the workers were  begging for it, but because the bosses were begging for a regime of  enforceable labor contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The purpose of the Wagner regime was to divert labor away from the  asymmetric warfare model to a new one, in which union bureaucrats  enforced the terms of contracts on their own membership. The primary  function of union bureaucracies, under the new order, was to suppress  wildcat action by their rank and file, to suppress direct action on the  job, and to limit labor action to declared strikes under NLRB rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The New Deal labor agenda had the same practical effect as telling the  militiamen at Lexington and Concord to come out from behind the rocks,  put on bright red uniforms, and march in parade ground formation, in  return for a system of arbitration to guarantee they didn’t lose all the time.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:24&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:24&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;36&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, in conjunction with the increase in peer-to-peer networks of individual producers, and the likely prevalence of worker cooperatives, will likely force even the corporations that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; exist in the freed market to be far more beneficial to those who work for them. Competition for workers on the one hand, and union power on the other, will make the workplace of the reciprocal order very different from the workplace of today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this free market, there will be no official, privileged currency, which only a few banks have the right to inflate and which is the only valid legal tender for paying debts and taxes. Instead, individuals will be free to form mutual banks, and create and trade currency as they please. This will lead to low interest credit being available for all, instead of just the rich and powerful, and to the degree that there is inflation, it will be regulated by the market at large and used for the benefit of the majority, instead of hurting them.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:14:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:14&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:15:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:15&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:26&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:26&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:27&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:27&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:28&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:28&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This will make sure that low cost credit is far more available for individuals to acquire their own capital, without having to go to a capitalist, thereby increasing individual autonomy in the economy. It is also possible that credit, debt, and money will be totally different without a state.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:29&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:29&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;40&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conjunction with all of this, as well as free (and mutual) banking ensuring that inflation is used, when it exists at all, to benefit everyday individuals instead of the rich and powerful, and that everyone can get low-interest credit, the forces of individuals producing and trading private property, in other words, the free market, will tend strongly towards socialist ends.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:30&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:30&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;41&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:31&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:31&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;42&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:32&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:32&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;43&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:33&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:33&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;44&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:34&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:34&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;45&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  To quote from Kevin Carson:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The natural effect of unfettered market competition is socialism. For a short time the innovator receives a large profit, as a reward for  being first to the market. Then, as competitors adopt the innovation,  competition drives these profits down to zero and the price gravitates  toward the new, lower cost of production made possible by this  innovation (that price including, of course, the cost of the producer’s  maintenance and the amortization of her capital outlays). So in a free  market, the cost savings in labor required to produce any given  commodity would quickly be socialized in the form of reduced labor cost  to purchase it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Only when the state enforces artificial scarcities, artificial  property rights, and barriers to competition, is it possible for a  capitalist to appropriate some part of the cost savings as a permanent  rent. The capitalist, under these conditions, is enabled to engage in  monopoly pricing. That is, rather than being forced by competition to  price her goods at the actual cost of production (including her own  livelihood), she can target the price to the consumer’s ability to pay.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:30:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:30&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;41&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we would, hopefully at least, see an end to the strange, disjointed, and unhealthy individuals in our current society have with work itself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In theory, we can indeed eliminate  bullshit jobs, embrace automation, and shorten the individual work  schedule quite significantly and quite easily if not for the fact that  wages are not at living wage levels for a lot of people as is and  cutting their hours without compensation of some sort would hurt them  tremendously. Increased worker ownership would help solve some of this  problem since, as Wolff pointed out, worker cooperatives tend not to  fire workers, and thus if hours were shortened due to a decrease in  needed labor, the workers would still receive their same pay for the  same amount of production despite the decrease in needed labor. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:35&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:35&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;46&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-order-under-anarchy&quot;&gt;7. Order Under Anarchy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I stand ready to negotiate, but I want no part of laws: I acknowledge none; &lt;strong&gt;I protest against every order with which some authority may feel pleased on the basis of some alleged necessity to over-rule my free will. Laws: We know what they are, and what they  are worth! They are spider webs for the rich and mighty, steel chains  for the poor and weak, fishing nets in the hands of government.&lt;/strong&gt; — Pierre-Joseph Proudhon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;71-general-statements&quot;&gt;7.1. General Statements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common objection levied against anarchists, which is probably now at the forefront of the minds of any who have read this treatise up till know, is that in the absence of the state, it is impossible to provide any stable order for society. After all, how can a community of individuals subject to no legitimized authority from above, which sets down uniform laws that govern how all may act, provide security and protection for its members, and prevent or solve conflicts? How will they know what to do, and what is to ensure that they do it, if there is no group of people to force them all to a single plan?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This objection is the product of limited thinking. In the absence of law — that top-down imposition of rules by an authority to govern the actions of all, legitimized as the ‘one true way’ — humans do not suddenly lose the ability to compromise with others in order to achieve peace and prosperous relations. They likewise do not lose their social capacity for good feelings: trust, empathy, etc. Least of all do they lose that common sense intuition for the game theory of interacting with others that allows most people to intuit the content of the two principles of my ethic when they are given time and mental space away from ‘the law’ to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An order that is founded on the autonomy of each individual participating in it, to recognize and compromise where necessary, convenient, or beneficial, and defend one’s own interests and the interests of others in like conditions, can be just as stable as — if not more stable than — an order founded on the top-heavy conception that all order must stem from authority and imposition, instead of compromise and stigmergy. After all, when power is distributed or decentralized, there is no one central locus of control that, if captured, brings the rest of society to its knees. There is no single failure point, and there are true ‘checks and balances,’ in a system where no one has any more control over the behavior and norms than any other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these general statements in mind, I think it is time to elaborate in more depth how protection and conflict resolution might be provided in a system without laws, given that the description of economic organization given above depends on some kind of coherent, stable order. Keep in mind that the same caveats about ‘planning’ an anarchist society that I voiced above are in full effect here: this is all speculation, and trying to state that this &lt;em&gt;must be&lt;/em&gt; how it will turn out, or trying to enforce such a result in an attempt to make it the only ‘legitimate’ option, would defeat the entire purpose of anarchism in the first place. I am merely presenting what I believe to be the most beneficial and probable methods of providing order to an anarchist society. Even within the context of these projection-suggestions, keep in mind that they will never be, and should never be, the sole source of legitimate decisions. There &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; no legitimacy or illegitimacy under anarchism, only what each individual thinks is correct, because there is no grant of authority to some standard, person, or group of people to decide what everyone says, thinks, or does regarding any matter, and the concept of a single legitimate outcome is a centralizing and hierarchical force itself. In the face of all these caveats, it is nonetheless interesting and sometimes profitable to speculate about how things might be done within the limits of a certain socio-ethical theory, so I will proceed with my analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;72-a-picture-of-order&quot;&gt;7.2. A Picture of Order&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first place, it should be noted that a reciprocal order, once established and understood, is stable in itself: each individual is motivated to continue cooperating with everyone else, even if they are not particularly interested in the cooperation of a specific person, because if they cease cooperation with that person, they might well lose cooperation from others. When they cease cooperation with someone, they run the risk of accruing a negative reputation: others become less sure of positive cooperation on their part being met with positive cooperation, making it less in their interest. If someone does not cooperate with your neighbor when it suits them not to, what is to guarantee that they will cooperate with you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, however, is actually a very forgiving system of enforcement, as it may take some time for someone’s reputation to be damaged enough to instill such doubts, meaning that a general loss of cooperation from the community, instead of just the individual harmed, won’t be immediate, preventing the whole network of reciprocal interactions from crumbling at the first violation. Additionally, this is a response that scales humanely with the severity and frequency of violations on the part of violator, as it operates on the basis of concerns for themselves and views on fairness on the part of the other members of the community, not some unilaterally instituted rule for punishment of violations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will probably not be an overly heavy-handed mechanism of ‘mob justice’ and enforcement of authoritarian social norms, either. After all, no community need be, or will be, wholly of the same mind on a matter. Some may choose to sanction someone for something, but others may choose not to, and it is in the interest of all not to take overly violent or enthusiastic action for fear of general cooperation breaking down. There is no single decided and legitimate outcome, even if a mediator is involved, so the community can arrive at a punishment stigmergically: if some believe others are punishing someone too harshly, they can try to lighten the load and vice versa, and the balance will be determined by the strength of either side’s convictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor would anyone who values autonomy attempt to use the forces of general social agreement to squash someone else’s autonomy, when a culture of doing so would likely hurt them just as much in the long run. Of course, general social oppression could not automatically be avoided in this way — anarchy is not a utopia — but neither is it avoided under the state, and at least absent a state, those oppressed will have no unilateral system making them behave nicely and peacefully toward their oppressors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not an overly light-handed mechanism for enforcement, either. If someone truly commits a serious crime, one which cannot be solved through restitution and restorative justice, and which demonstrates a serious danger to others in the community, there will be a strong incentive on the part of each individual embedded in the network that interacts with the criminal to take the necessary steps to protect themselves and each other. For instance, if there is a serial killer in our midst, it would be naturally in my interest to take it into my hands to put them out of their misery to prevent further harm to myself and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note, however, that this is not an inherently &lt;em&gt;legitimate&lt;/em&gt; action, the perpetration of which is protected from question and investigation. If some people think I shouldn’t have killed the person I did — perhaps they think I didn’t have the right person, or went about it the wrong way, or there were innocent casualties —I am now on the hook for that. There is no ‘qualified immunity’ in a stateless society!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, all of this runs the risk of fracturing the community around a particularly contentious crime, creating blood feuds and lasting, ongoing violence and damage, destroying the harmonious functioning of a reciprocal society. This is where mediators and investigators come in. Mediators are useful both for restoring conditions of peaceful positive cooperation between two or more individuals directly involved in a conflict, but they are also useful in the performative demonstration of listening to all sides of the story, and all sides’ interests, and constructing a narrative about what happened and what should happen next. Nobody will be bound to adhere to this narrative, there is no ‘official’ outcome, but nevertheless, in healing rifts and disagreements in communities, this is a crucial office. Perhaps it could be performed for money by some who specialize in it, or simply by someone whom the community views as sufficiently wise and neutral, or by several such people until an agreed-upon resolution is reached, I cannot say, but I do know that mediation is a crucial element here. Likewise, in aid of those mediators, investigators, who specialize in interviewing people, analyzing evidence, and so on, will likely be important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of a direct clustered network of reciprocal interactions, or in situations where there is low trust and low social knowledge, this process could be reified to some degree by mutual protection associations: in the event that one person is injured in some way, the rest of the organization agrees to participate in laying some sanction on the perpetrator (after establishing that their member is in the wrong, of course, to avoid an unnecessary expenditure of resources and social capital). This sanction could take the form of refusal to trade, ostracism, or even physical violence, and would probably be engaged in only if no restitution to their member was possible, or none was offered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it is likely that the perpetrator, if they were not so overly prone to crimes that no mutual protection association would commit to protecting them, would have their own protection association, who would want to protect their interests to some degree, even if they weren’t willing to commit fully to protecting them because they agreed that their member was in the wrong. Thus, it would be crucial, in order to avoid costly and possibly ongoing conflicts, to appeal to mediators who have a reputation for fairness, and to agree in contract to some resolution of the situation that is agreeable to both sides. Indeed, it might even be profitable for the purpose of stability to create contracts between associations before any conflict occurs, so that in the event of a conflict between two of their members, there is already an understood and respected procedure in place for handling matters. These contracts might include a mutual understanding of what counts as a violation (different from the rules the associations enforce within their ranks, if they do so at all), what to do in such cases, procedures for establishing guilt and the extent of harm, and procedures concerning the limits of restitution and retribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mutual protection associations would not need to be a solely out-facing phenomena, either. Providing mediation and an established code of norms between their members, democratically decided-upon, might be a quite useful service. This would be superior to how the state provides such services in that the association is non-hierarchical and directly accountable to each of its members, and also because it would be possible to leave an association without legitimate ramifications enshrined in institutions, laws, and society, such as having to leave behind one’s home and property, or being killed or imprisoned for treason. This ability to leave means that, by and large, no individual need be governed by rules that they do not agree to; the only concessions they need make is to other people who do not agree to live by the same rules, but even then that is not required, only motivated in order to avoid conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, in this vision of conflict resolution, every side has allies in a conflict representing and supporting their interests to one degree or another. There is not a single organization that enforces a single mold of ‘justice’ from above onto the community as a whole. Instead, it is merely the interaction of people, on relatively the same footing, figuring out agreements about conduct and resolutions to conflicts as best suits them, with all of the local information and context at their disposal. This egalitarian view of justice, where it is imposed by incentives and equal individuals, instead of something from on high, is bolstered by its decentralized nature. If every person is, in effect, a law unto themselves, and there is no recognized legitimate set of rules or punishments beyond what those involved agree on, there is no single apparatus that can be seized in order to inflict one’s will on others. Even if a whole mutual protection association ‘goes rogue’ and refuses to cooperate with others, the rest of the society can band against it and crush it under their greater numbers. And if an association begins to abuse its members — which is unlikely, given that the members are the ones who control the actions of such an association, and the purpose of the organization is not one that even remotely requires hierarchy — it is in the interest of the other associations to step in to defend the minority members of that association thus abused in order to gain their loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that in such a society, it would profit no one to have prisons. If those who want to hold people in prisons must pay for the cost of doing so, they will quickly realize that they are only further hurting themselves, after whatever harm the perpetrator of the harm did, in order to get revenge on the prisoner. Why commit to this course of action, when it is even remotely possible to reintegrate people back into society, since once they are thus reintegrated there is no ongoing cost, and perhaps some ongoing benefits?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus we arrive at a patchwork view of social order, where most ‘law’ is provided by merely the necessity of living with other humans and avoiding, or satisfactorily ending, conflicts. For the most part, institutionalized order will not be necessary, as the Nash equilibrium of social order does its work. Order will reinforce itself, and ‘law’, as embodied in agreements, will be fluid, built and destroyed as needed, and individualized to the specific relevant case. In the few occasions where such institutions are needed, they will be radically egalitarian and decentralized, ensuring that there is competition and free agreement as much as possible for everyone, and that everyone’s interests are represented. This is what I call &lt;strong&gt;the reciprocal order.&lt;/strong&gt; As Proudhon says, liberty (autonomy) is “not the daughter, but the mother of order.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;81-the-law&quot;&gt;8.1. The Law&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the striking features of the reciprocal order is that in it, everyone’s interests are represented; order is preserved and conflicts are resolved on a horizontal plane, between equals, where there is not one single verdict or outcome that is universally true or correct. This is in stark contrast to the law of the State, which is enforced from above: each side appeals to a third party (the State) instead of to each other, and it does not matter what &lt;em&gt;either&lt;/em&gt; side thinks the correct outcome is, nor what everyone else involved in the conflict thinks the outcome should be; only what the State believes is best matters. It is the State’s sole power to perform unilateral action against those it deems ‘guilty’ without repercussions or consideration for the interests of the guilty party. Often, this hurts all parties to the conflict, since the State, being a representative always ultimately only of itself, and which can enforce whatever it so desires without considering the interests of either person, has no interest in making the victim whole again, in restitution or making life return to a cooperative balance. No, it punishes the ‘guilty’ party because they have offended it, and makes the victim pay for it, and leaves both the worse for wear. It leaves the ‘criminal’ with no pathway to joining society again, and therefore little incentive to avoid committing crimes anymore — after all, they will suffer either way, because they are forever marked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The law of the state is the ultimate violation of autonomy: it descends on all involved, in every case of law, and enforces its will on others without thought for what they want, even when these actions are totally consensual and/or effect no one, and so are not violations of the reciprocal order. It takes property, it gives property, it protects property the very existence of which is a violation of the autonomy of others greater than the autonomy that property represents. It fights wars. It prevents the reciprocal order from forming by preventing people from protecting themselves or others, from constituting alternatives to its enforcement methods. It puts the enforcement of cooperation in respecting autonomy, insofar as it does enforce this instead of violating it, in the hands of people no one consented to do this for them, and prevents other options from forming. The state is the ultimate abomination from the stand point of my two principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;82-the-state-as-a-force-of-decay-and-atomization&quot;&gt;8.2. The State as a Force of Decay and Atomization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the important things to realize is that the very existence of the State not only violates the rules of the reciprocal order, but, as touched on in earlier sections, causes it to decay. After all, if your treatment is not up to your neighbors and those you interact with, but is enforced from above (whether you are treated with respect, or punished), one has little interest or care for what others think of you or how you treat them. If you treat someone poorly, and get away with it, &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; may know what you have done, but what can they do to you that the State will not stop? Hence the very existence of a top-down order of Law destroys much of the inherent interest we have in treating each other well, building trust and communities and relationships, outside of the State and what it can enforce, which is surprisingly little when it comes to the actual harm against people. After all, it is in the State’s direct interest to enforce the collection of taxes and other such laws that benefit those in power, but as for actually protecting the people? They care little for that; after all, the people will placidly accept pretty much whatever they do, believing in the lie of the legitimacy of the organization that oppresses them. What little they do care for protecting the individual stems from doing just enough to preserve the fictional legitimacy they hold. They have even made this clear:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Neither the Constitution, nor state law, impose a  general duty upon police officers or other governmental officials to  protect individual persons from harm — even when they know the harm will occur,” said Darren L. Hutchinson, a professor and associate dean at  the University of Florida School of Law. “Police can watch someone  attack you, refuse to intervene and not violate the Constitution.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the government has only a  duty to protect persons who are “in custody,” he pointed out.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:36&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:36&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;47&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The State also frays the reciprocal order by its very existence in other ways. For one thing, it is a tool of immense power to enact any social or economic change any group wishes to see. Once a State is introduced into society, the race is on to see who can capture it first in order to bend everyone else to their will, be it ‘benevolent’ or not. Worse, every side must compete all the harder for control over the Ring of Power that is the State because, were their enemies, or even those with simply a different vision of the world than they, to seize control of it, it would be worse for them than if no one had control of the State! Thus, by its very existence the State fosters an endless war of all against all for control of the apparatus of power. All the while, of course, those who seek nothing more than power and are willing to do anything to get it hide behind the fiction of legitimacy, social contracts, and constitutions as slowly strangle their society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a state already in place to defend property that others have little interest in respecting otherwise, and to give them privileges, monopolies, and subsidies, it will be difficult for anyone to become too rich, especially on the backs of exploited others, and so it will be exponentially more difficult for any one person to become powerful enough to institute a state themselves. Indeed, to become rich, one would need to already be rich in order to put together what is necessary to defend and acquire the riches one intends to gain, unless one really intends to engage in a war against everyone else. Hence, in a society with no respect for authority, and respect for other’s autonomy only if it is reciprocated and only if it does not severely curtail their own, it will be almost impossible for Kings, Presidents, or Ministers to ever arise again. Thus, the reciprocal order protects itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;83-the-state-and-culture&quot;&gt;8.3. The State and Culture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, this vision of a possible society as a mesh network of individual peers interacting reciprocally relies on the majority of the people in it sharing certain cultural beliefs concerning legitimacy, authority, and hierarchy. This is not a difficulty unique to an anarchist order, though: all power structures ultimately rest on public opinion. Whatever the public views as illegitimate ultimately crumbles and falls away, and whatever it sees as legitimate is raised up in response. The state cannot exist if its citizens do not placidly submit to its auspices, either crying its praises or mumbling about how it is a ‘necessary evil’ and there is no other option but to accept it. If its citizens refuse to cooperate with it, to lend it their compliance and their support, it will be paralyzed: it will be a few oligarchs and politicians sitting around a table giving orders futilely to people who will not listen to their ranting and raving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply because a man declares himself king or president, it does not become so; most must accept his rule as law, and some must flock to him to enforce his will against the few that dissent. If all dissent, even excepting those few enforcers, where is his power? To quote Etienne de la Boetie, from &lt;em&gt;Discourse of Voluntary Servitude&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Poor, wretched, and stupid peoples, nations determined on your own  misfortune and blind to your own good! You let yourselves be deprived  before your own eyes… You live in such a way that you cannot claim a single thing as your own; and it  would seem that you consider yourselves lucky to be loaned your  property, your families, and your very lives. All this havoc, this  misfortune, this ruin, descends upon you not from alien foes, but from  the one enemy whom you yourselves render as powerful as he is, for whom you go bravely to war, for whose greatness you do not refuse to offer your own bodies unto death.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;He who thus domineers over you has only two eyes, only two hands, only one body, no more than is possessed by the least man among the infinite numbers dwelling in your cities; he has indeed nothing more than the power that you confer upon him to destroy you. Where has he acquired enough eyes to spy upon you, if you do not provide them yourselves? How can he have so many arms to beat you with, if he does not borrow them from you? The feet that trample down your cities, where does he get them if they are not your own? How does he  have any power over you except through you? How would he dare assail you if he had no cooperation from you? What could he do to you if you  yourselves did not connive with the thief who plunders you, if you were not accomplices of the murderer who kills you, if you were not traitors to yourselves?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;From all these indignities, such as the very beasts of the field would not endure, you can deliver yourselves if you try, not by taking action, but merely by willing to be free. &lt;strong&gt;Resolve to serve no more, and you are at  once freed. I do not ask that you place hands upon the tyrant to topple him over, but simply that you support him no longer; then you will behold him, like a great Colossus whose pedestal has been pulled away, fall of his own weight and break in pieces.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:47&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:47&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;48&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ask why anarchy was overtaken by states in the long past is the same as asking why democracy did not form before monarchy: in both cases the question ignores the changing cultural factors that make different power structures possible in the first place. The form of anarchy that humans had in the deep past was based on tribal chieftains, patriarchs and matriarchs, it was not averse to hierarchy and authority, merely not populous enough yet to support the more rigid kinds of it. It was not an ideological anarchy, an anarchy supported by cultural norms against rulers and bolstered by an understanding of the proper ways to organize a decentralized, distributed society. It was anarchy born out of the fact that society was not ready for kings yet. So when society was ready for kings, they took over easily. The cultural beliefs were not ready to support stable anarchy against the impositions of rulers. Likewise, democracy did not form before monarchy because the cultural beliefs behind it, about the equality of all, and government being a representative of the collective will for the collective defense, the ideas of social contract theory, had not yet begun to form, let alone percolate into society. Democracy &lt;em&gt;could not&lt;/em&gt; have formed before those ideas came about, because the culture would not have accepted and maintained it. In the places where something like modern democracy did form, such as Athens, it was precisely because the culture there believed it to be legitimate, and did not believe kings to be so. Likewise, stable anarchy &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; form before the ideas in it percolate similarly. Therefore it is no more a criticism of democracy’s stability that it did not form as soon as more than two humans got together, than that stable anarchy did not. Not all ages of history are interchangeable: simply because something did not arise then, does not mean it cannot arise now, because &lt;em&gt;culture matters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus the two most common criticisms of anarchism, first that it is dependent on predominant cultural values, and second that it has not already occurred in history, are shown to grow from the same core fallacy: ignoring the power that public cultural opinion has over &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; things. The statist order is just as subject to the whims of the people as an anarchist one, and the existence of both is defined and limited to the time period in which the cultural values that make them legitimate exist. Monarchy’s time is past, democracy’s time is now, and anarchy’s time is the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also forms the basis of a response to another common objection to anarchy, as opposed to the state. Under the rule of the state, I hear it said, this or that can be achieved by enough people voting in favor of it. Thus, the state’s existence brings about an assurance that certain things can be done. The state can be used to prevent bigotry, to provide for the poor, and other such things. What, under anarchy, can be done? To answer this, it one must realize that someone asking this question is hiding the ball: if there are enough people to &lt;em&gt;vote&lt;/em&gt; for something, there are enough people to contribute to actually doing it directly. If the majority of society is able to vote successfully to end bigotry — than most of society isn’t bigoted. If most of society wants a social safety net, than most of society can organize into a federation of mutual aid organizations to provide for each other. Whatever the democratic state does for the people, it does on the basis of the majority’s desire for it to do that thing (that is not to say that it &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; or even &lt;em&gt;often&lt;/em&gt; does what the people want), and whatever the democratic state can do, the people who vote can do directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;9-conclusion-praxis&quot;&gt;9. Conclusion: Praxis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have arrived at the truth, but most people are still deluded believers in error; therefore, we must educate these people — via lectures, discussions, books, pamphlets, newspapers, or whatever — until  they become converted to the correct point of view. For a minority to  become a majority, a process of persuasion and conversion must take  place — in a word, education.&lt;br /&gt;
— Murray Rothbard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Beneath the governmental machinery, in the shadow of political  institutions, out of the sight of statesmen and priests, society is  producing its own organism, slowly and silently; and constructing a new  order, the expression of its vitality and autonomy, and the denial of  the old politics, as well as of the old religion.&lt;br /&gt;
— Pierre-Joseph Proudhon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how do we get from here to there? How would a set of individuals committed to an ethic of reciprocity and the society envisioned therein ensure that the social norms and cultural knowledge are in place to support a transition from the  &lt;em&gt;status quo&lt;/em&gt; to an order based on an ethic of reciprocity? There are three things such a group (‘we’ from here on) must do, and two it must not. The road I endorse is long and difficult, but I think it is ultimately worth it for anyone committed to the ideas of autonomy, individualism, and peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing we must do is to educate others. Reveal to them the brutality of the state and its illegitimacy; tear down the curtains of the temple of ‘legitimate’ authority and show everyone the feeble little man that works the controls behind them; show that we need not choose between individual freedom and subjugation to the powerful on the one hand, and individual bondage to the collective on the other; explain how freed markets work and how things can be done without the state; explain a proper ethic of life and rid the minds of our neighbors of the propaganda bogymen that haunt them. This education will provide the soil from which all else must grow. All that is necessary for the state to wither, and a stable order of liberty to grow in its place, is that enough of us reject concepts alien to individual autonomy and embrace reciprocity; we must retract the prostrate acceptance of the &lt;em&gt;status quo&lt;/em&gt; that allows it to run roughshod over us without objection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing we must do is build: build alternative organizations, alternative methods of doing things here and now, under the capitalist, statist system, as best we can. A purely intellectual, purely destructive or deconstructive movement is infertile, fallow. We must instead demonstrate that our methods and theories work, insofar as we can, and learn the practical knowledge that will be necessary to construct a stable and functional order in the absence of a state. This positive, constructive, practical action, which can help people even in the present, will draw people to our cause, and prepare society for when, or if, the state does indeed wither away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third thing we must do is &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt;. No theory is ever complete, because humans are not omniscient. We must not let theory become stagnant dogma, not open to revision or improvement in light of new ideas or new data. We must also let our theories interface with their opposites, their competitors, and their counterpoints. All the best ideas, in my experience, arise from a synthesis of many different sources, each with their criticisms of each other. Thus our theories must exist in a constant state of dialectic refinement or it will die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two things we must &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; do, however. First, we must &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; enforce our ideas on others. I explained why in detail previously, but to reiterate: to force our ideas of social organization — either the absence of a state, or specific choices in that state’s absence — on others would be to defeat the entire purpose of allowing individuals full autonomy to explore their options. If a community chooses to not respect certain parts of autonomy, as long as they do so voluntarily, then it would be a violation of their autonomy to try to stop them. Perhaps it might be in our interests to avoid joining such a community or interacting with it, or even to help those who want to escape to do so, but there is no single plan for life and social organization that &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be followed, only ones that are better or worse for some goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, we must not become unduly violent. Violence begets violence, death begets death, and blood begets blood. A new order born in indiscriminate bloodshed will live and die by blood, because it breaks reciprocity and sets a standard for all to see and all to take advantage of in a race to the bottom — a race to death. Nor is it an attractive thing; it is primarily only those who are happy with violence, who revel in it, and who are looking for an excuse to do it will join a revolution of blood and death and stay with it. That is not what anyone who values peace, autonomy, and reciprocal cooperation wants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that this essay has, in its own small way, contributed to the education component of praxis. I know that it is not wholly original, but I hope that the method of presentation, and the specific arguments put forth here, having largely sprung from my own head, might provide an interesting perspective, and convince a few people who would not otherwise have been convinced. I do not envision the state crumbling today, or tomorrow, or the day after that. I do not envision the oligarchs relinquishing their golden-gloved grip on our throats easily. There is no quick change that we can effect. Yet, not deterred, I write this in service of a brighter, better tomorrow that &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; still be, that &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be. It may happen a decade hence, a century, a millennium; it may never happen; but as long as I am around I will try to increase the chances that it does. I hope that those who share my values, or come to share them, will join with me in doing likewise.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;In the market as it currently is today, inflation has two harmful effects on the working class and poor. Firstly, as inflation goes on, prices rise, as corporations are more than willing to raise prices in order to get more profits. This does not translate to workers’ wages, however: corporations are far less motivated to raise wages, only motivated to do so by the competition of other corporations, and so if they can they won’t do so. Inflation, and the common ignorance of people regarding it, provides a signal that can be used to form essentially a wage cartel without any centralized planning or direction, as corporations refuse to raise wages, and so prices go up while wages largely stagnate. Moreover, inflated money is not air-dropped evenly throughout the economy, so those who get the new money first (the rich and powerful) get to spend it at pre-inflation prices, but as it circulates through the economy those who get it later benefit from it less and less, until it eventually gets to the poor, who have been paying the higher, inflated prices for a long time, and only now get a commensurate increase in wages (if they even do). &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:26&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“There is no longer a single idea explaining everything, but an infinite number of essences giving a meaning to an infinite number of objects.  The world comes to a stop, but also lights up.” 
	― Albert Camus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-introduction&quot;&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my previous essay in this series, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tbdp-web.github.io/blog/2021/10/11/life-meaning.html&quot;&gt;‘Human Being and the World, Part I’&lt;/a&gt;, I talked about the core facts of what it is &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; to be human. How our consciousness operates, how we perceive and interact with ourselves and the world around us. I examined how our thrownness, being embedded in and shaped by existence, is crucial to us being alive in the first place. I also hinted at the core problems that grow out of this mode of existence that I call ‘human Being,’ which normative philosophy tries to solve. In this essay, I’ll talk a bit more in detail about what those problems are, and why they are a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three core problems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Not knowing what we want automatically, but having to guess&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Desiring to embed ourselves in narratives external to us, instead of embedding everything in our own narrative&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Knowing that the actions we take indicate intrinsic values and beliefs that we either deny — and become hypocrites — or accept&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will elaborate on why each of these things is a problem in the next sections&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-desire&quot;&gt;2. Desire&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I described in my previous essay, there are two layers (or modes) of consciousness: the egoistic layer, and the narrative layer. The egoistic layer is where desire, pleasure, pain, instinct, action, and the basic understanding of the world we experience takes place. The narrative layer, on the other hand, is where our conscious thoughts and experience takes place, where the strange loop of self-awareness becomes possible. These two layers are alien to each other; the narrative layer can only look at the egoistic layer from the outside, guessing what is going on inside it by the vague feelings that it exports — the rewards for certain states of being, pain, pleasure, joy, fulfillment, sadness. There is no table in the egoistic layer that contains a set of propositions describing what will make you happy, only a vague mechanism, like a high-dimensional reward function. Desire is a vector, not a destination, and the narrative layer must take those vectors and try to triangulate the final destination, if there is one. Sometimes there is, and sometimes the desires, being the product of a fuzzy and imprecise intuitive mechanism, are contradictory and cannot all be satisfied. You never know in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most cases, it is easy to figure out where your desires are pointing, so easy, in fact, that the narrative layer fools itself into thinking that it is directly &lt;em&gt;introspecting&lt;/em&gt; into the contents of the desires of the egoistic layer. This is still not the case, however; what is really happening is that there is enough data, and the data is clear enough, that it is such a simple task to abduct the correct answer that it seems trivial. This is seen in other areas, too, when people draw a conclusion so easily from the premises they are given that they barely seem to notice that they have done any reasoning at all. This is the case with desires such as hunger, for instance. But as soon as the desires become more complicated, the task of the narrative layer becomes significantly more difficult: deciding not just that you want to eat, but &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; you want to eat, for instance, or choosing a career path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the tools that the narrative consciousness layer uses to mitigate some of this difficulty is that of consideration, imagining hypothetical scenarios where different attempts are made to satisfy the desires of the egoistic layer, and feeding vivid reconstructions of those states of being to the egoistic layer to see what emotions it returns. Do this well enough, and vividly enough, and it can become much easier to divine where the desire-vectors are pointing, although it is always an inexact science and depends one one’s ability to actually accurately imagine these states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tool, again, might make it seem like the desires of the egoistic layer are available to the introspection of the narrative layer, since presenting a situation to the egoistic layer and consulting the feelings that are returned is a similar process to simply considering the question “do I want X?” and examining the answer that results. This is still not what is actually happening, however; first of all, this process of getting desires based on hypothetical imaginings is based on one’s ability to accurately picture what the results of a situation are. Secondly, you are not getting back a yes or a no, but a feeling, and that does not rule out the fact that that feeling might be greater for something else, or might change later. Third, these feelings that are returned are not always consistent, and can change given even a few seconds. Fourth, our knowledge about our desires is not transparent to us, but limited to what we can think to check; even if we pretend that sending a hypothetical to the egoistic layer of consciousnes is a table lookup, we still do not have access to the full table, and so we don’t have access to all the complexities of our desires, only to the results they give based on the things we can guess to check, which means we will always be missing details because complex things have a very low probability of being guessed in their entire detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, human beings are left with a singular problem: we have little idea of what we truly want, what will truly bring us happiness and fulfillent, even when we think we might have found it. This is why virtue ethics fundamentally fails: it tries to divine a description of the desires of &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; people, when we hardly know what our own desires are! &lt;a href=&quot;https://tbdp-web.github.io/blog/2021/12/08/egoism.html&quot;&gt;(This is why I am an egoist first and foremost)&lt;/a&gt;. Even though virtue ethics could overcome the is-ought gap, by appealing to desires directly (something Hume said would work), if its philosophers could come up with a reasonably exact set of desires that all human beings share, attempting to do so is pretty much nonsense, especially when you realize that all desires are not compatible, but must be weighed in balance with each other, so that even if we had two desires all human beings shared. I admit that there are some things that all human beings seem to share a general desire for — independance, companionship, society, material welfare — but what satisfies these is so complex, so wide, and so varied that little of normative content can be derived from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than this, since desires are not destinations, not propositions describing states of affairs inscribed on the stone table of our mind, desires can never be truly satisfied. There will always be some overshot, or some undershot, of what we actually want, and our desires can shift based on past experiences of satisfied desires, too. So the process of desire-satisfaction is a process of always moving toward, but never reaching, equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, desires inherently cannot be satisfied in one’s lifetime, because the process of life itself inherently &lt;em&gt;means&lt;/em&gt; that some desires are not satisfied yet! To cease desiring things, is to cease desiring life with which to do and achieve things, to cease desiring life itself, and therefore to die, because life requires maintenence. This is why Buddhism is death itself, why the ‘Four Noble Truths’ are a syllogism of death. Quoting from Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Suffering is an innate characteristic of existence in the world.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Suffering arises from desire.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The cessation of desire can be attained by renouncing desire.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Eightfold Path is the path leading to the renouncement of desire and the cessation of suffering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If suffering (the dissatisfaction of desire) is life, and ceasing to desire would end suffering, then ceasing desire would end life because life is suffering. And this is true: desiring things that you don’t yet have is what leads you to maintain your life, to eat, to drink, to exercise. To stop desiring those things would be to die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is more wrong with this response to the fact that your desires are unknowable and unsatisfiable in an ultimate sense, however. To give up on all desires because your desires cannot be satisfied is to make perfect the enemy of good: yes, your desires cannot be perfectly, finally satisfied, but they can be satisfied to some degree, and giving up on those pleasures, some very notable and worthwhile, because sometimes you will have pain, or can’t have all the pleasure you want, is foolish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, positing something which can fully and permanently satisfy your desires is itself positing death, or, if you believe you can continue to live without desiring more things, an existence of eternal stagnation, in which you exist in a sort of stasis, never changing, never doing anything meaningful. This is the reality which Christians propose, accepting the dichotemy that says that either one must have a perfect satisfaction of desire, or it would be better to never want anything at all. This isn’t to mention the fact that the existence of a desire for something does not itself provide evidence that it exists — the desires that we have sometimes correlate to things that exist, but they don’t always, because human beings are creatures of imagination, and we can construct impossible, counterfactual hypotheticals to show to our egoistic layer of consciousness and get feelings about. Those ‘natural desires’ (to use C.S. Lewis’ imprecise and imbecile terminology) that we have that do seem to necessarily correspond to earl things exist because the things they point at are physically, verifiably necessary for our survival, and if we did not have a desire for them we would die. This is why we desire food and it also exists: not because desires are necessarily correlated with reality, not because the existence of food caused us to desire it, not because our desire caused food to exist, but because we exist as creatures that require sustinence, we would have died out had that sustinence not been avaiable and so the only creatures living are ones that have food for them to eat, and we needed some reward in our reward function to motivate us to eat without the need to reason it out from the top down.

&lt;p&gt;The second problem that humans face is the result of a &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; desire, that I feel comfortable in making such certain statements about because it is the  necessary prerequisite for the egoistic and narrative layers of our consciousness to function together: the desire to construct narratives itself. Even here, I will try to avoid being overly specific about this desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, though, the principle on which it works is simple: there is a term in the reward function of the egoistic layer of consciousness which stands for the desire to “run,” or switch to, the narrative mode or layer; the function of the narrative layer, in turn, is to weave our past actions, our current situation, and the features, objects, and facts of the world around us into the most coherent narrative it can make. This is then what it uses to generate thoughts out of, to process things using our reasoning abilities, and so on, the results and actions of which are all woven back into the narrative. When this narrative is disrupted, the narrative layer incapable of fulfilling its function fully, crises emerge: PTSD, identity crises, self-hatred, despair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way the narrative layer usually works is that it weaves other things into a narrative based around the self: a story about who you are, what happened to you, and how that shaped you. The self is the anchor to everything else, it looks at objects of consciousness and asks “what is this thing’s relation to me?” When the awareness is turned upon onself, when consciousness itself becomes its own object, there are two ways of processing self-awareness into the narrative layer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first, is the most logical, but also, in this day and age, the rarest: one looks at the self and only changes the object of the sentence’s verb above, which is the object of awareness, and nothing else, because all that has changed is the object of awareness, and so only the object of awareness need be replaced in the thought process. Thus the sentence becomes “what is my relation to me?” Thus the only thing of import when considering oneself would be what one wants, what one things of oneself and one’s character, etc. All would be relative to the self, nothing would matter outside of my desires and what I choose, all would be based on the nexus that is me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing that can happen is all-too-common, and very dangerous. When the object of awareness is moved, the sentence is changed, but it is changed more than is made strictly necessary by this change in the object of awareness, because &lt;em&gt;the person doing the thinking is used to analyzing an object in terms of its relation to a narrative apart from itself.&lt;/em&gt; That is, when you look at something outside yourself, you are also outside it, and so its relation to you is that of one between two separate things; whereas when you look at yourself, your own relation to yourself is a relation of two identities that are interpenitrated (and identical). Thus, not only the object of the verb is changed, but the thing it is related “to.” Of course, then the question becomes, what should this second thing be replaced &lt;em&gt;by?&lt;/em&gt; We have a sentence that asks “what is my relation to…” what? What should I measure myself up to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This confusion opens us up to all sorts of fallacious answers, because &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; answers to this question must be fallacious, because there is no “right” answer. Just as reading from a random location in memory that hasn’t been filled or erased gives gibberish answers, so too are the answers given to this question, which is the core of the question ‘what is the meaning of life’ question for most people. People substitute communities, Gods, movements, ideologies. They submit their interests, and the narrative &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; want to spin about their life, to the ‘grander’ narratives of other people instead. It is not wrong to join a community, a movement, to subscribe to an ideology, but when these things go from “&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; am doing these things because they represent &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; values and because &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; want to” to “I am nothing without these things, these things define who I am, I must do what they say,” that is when the narrative has shifted. It is often slow and subtle, but it happens and can happen to all of us. It happens especially to religious people: their identity is subsumed by the identity of ‘being a Christian.’ They speak, think, and talk of nothing else, they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; a Christian and nothing else besides, their whole life revolves around this one thing. One way to prevent this subsumption of personal narrative under collective narrative is to have many identities and interests: these things are, at base, when they do not overcome you, a descriptor of a part of who you already are, not a commitment or a duty, and so the more identities you have, the more closely and accurately you represent, encode, and are helped to remember who you are. This is an inexact thing, it does not solve the problem, but it &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-the-values-in-our-actions&quot;&gt;4. The Values in Our Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final problem that human beings &lt;em&gt;qua&lt;/em&gt; human Being face is the fact that, our actions being controlled also by the narrative layer of our consciousness, which cannot help but generate beliefs and maxims about the permissibility of our actions in the process of acting, any action we take implies a statement. It implies that we think that that action is permissible. And if we are to apply our reason, to avoid special pleading, that means that we view that action as permissible in all relevantly similar circumstances. In the face of this, we must either become a hypocrite, and condemn in others what we do not condemn in ourselves, or we must acknowledge the same rights in others that we seize for ourselves. Each of these has consequences, as all choices have consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, as Sartre said in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/works/exist/sartre.htm&quot;&gt;‘Existentialism Is A Humanism’&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When a man commits himself to anything, fully realising that he is not  only choosing what he will be, but is thereby at the same time a  legislator deciding for the whole of mankind – in such a moment a man  cannot escape from the sense of complete and profound responsibility.  There are many, indeed, who show no such anxiety. But we affirm that  they are merely disguising their anguish or are in flight from it.  Certainly, many people think that in what they are doing they commit no  one but themselves to anything: and if you ask them, “What would happen  if everyone did so?” they shrug their shoulders and reply, “Everyone  does not do so.” But in truth, one ought always to ask oneself what  would happen if everyone did as one is doing; nor can one escape from  that disturbing thought except by a kind of self-deception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why, in my own philosophy, when I think about how I want everyone to act, how I want society to be, I act in a way that would facilitate that; and when I think about how I want to be, I grant others the right to be that way too — even if it has some detriment to me, I cannot judge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-conclusion&quot;&gt;5. Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This essay was much shorter than the previous one, in part because less setup was necessary to introduce the series, and in part because this essay specifically existed only to draw out some parts of the analysis that were already embrionic in the previous essay. The next essay will probably be even shorter, as it, too, is a distillation, a drawing-out, of things that are already present in this analysis, in order to suggest the direction for a solution more clearly than it is already suggested here.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If you can show me, with the same accuracy as we know this about food, that human beings require a relationship with a &lt;em&gt;real, existant&lt;/em&gt; god (and not just the idea of one) to continue existing, so that if that was not present we would have died out, and so that it would make sense for us to develop a desire to motivate use to form that connection, by all means, make your argument from desire for the existence of a god: only realize that now, in the process, you have to provide evidence that that god is real by other means, and so your argument is moot. Crucially, realize that saying that human beings require a god to exist because they require a creator is not the same thing, as it does not demonstrate the need for humans to &lt;em&gt;act&lt;/em&gt; (and hence &lt;em&gt;have a desire&lt;/em&gt;), because that relation is one way. You need to provide evidence that to continue existing for long humans require a two-way connection with a real god, one that requires action on the part of both parties, in the way that food requires eating and acquisition. I know many religious people &lt;em&gt;claim&lt;/em&gt; you need their god in order to live, but this has never been demonstrated to be true in any serious manner, especially not one that requires their god to be real and not just an idea, a concept, and something around which a community of mutual aid can form. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-introduction&quot;&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important role of philosophy, in the present scientific age, is that of a diagnostician and prescriptionist for the human condition. The rest of philosophy is either subservient to science, or made obsolete by it. All the great old metaphysical systems have fallen before modern physics, and new ones must gain their premises from it; the conceptual and logical analysis of the classical analytic philosophers finds its primary usefulness in helping science on its way; even epistemology is only useful insofar as it explains the formidable effectiveness of science or suggests incremental improvements to it. Only in the sphere of phenomenology, ethics, and the human condition — the sphere of &lt;em&gt;existential concerns&lt;/em&gt; — is philosophy still the prime mover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This revolutionary fact has, in a way, been recognized even by the mainstream community of academic philosophers; but, alas, they have responded incorrectly to it. Instead of focusing all their efforts on this last frontier of philosophic inquiry where science has not, and probably cannot, encroach, they have retreated in the opposite direction, becoming &lt;em&gt;historians of philosophy&lt;/em&gt;. They do not produce new systems, or reconcile the good components of old ones; they merely produce hermeneutic excavations. Even in the way philosophy is taught, this retreat can be seen. Gone are the days — if they ever existed, since formal training in philosophy began when the production of new philosophy was already on the decline —when students of philosophy are expected to actually &lt;em&gt;produce&lt;/em&gt; new philosophy, even late in their careers.  No, they are taught to learn what others thought, to put things in the terms of minds previous to, and therefore assumed to be greater than, theirs. Philosophy is, in fact, taught backwards: from the oldest and worst philosophies, to the newest and most robust and intellectually nuanced. Many never even reach that final stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, however, refuse to take the route that mainstream academic philosophy takes. I will freely admit that I am self-taught, and perhaps not the most well-read in primary sources. I will also freely admit that I may not be the most intelligent person to ever set their mind to philosophy. Nevertheless, I have only one mind to think with, and that is my own, and it tells me to set out upon this project, because too few besides me are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what is this project? Merely this: to produce an analysis of the human condition, a diagnosis of it, if you will, and then prescribe a possible solution to those problems. The task of the normative philosopher, like the doctor, is simply to explain to their audience what the problems are that are preventing them from achieving what they want, and methods they can use to achieve it. The patient complains to the doctor that something feels wrong, something is off; the doctor inspects them, asks them for specifics about how they feel, and eventually concludes: ah, here is your malady, and here is the solution. The normativity of this prescription comes from the already-felt, indelible desire of the patient for relief, and the choices the patient themselves make about how to move forward. Likewise, the normative philosopher — the philosopher whose concerns are existential ones — examines what it means to be a human, and prescribes solutions, when they can, for the problems and contradictions inherent in that condition; they are problems precisely because the desire for their alleviation is already felt, and therefore the normativity of his prescription may be had, as it were, for “free.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary challenge in the work of the normative philosopher is that of subjectivity. We, each of us, have access only to our own phenomena, mediated by our own situated existence and facticity; we must, therefore, be eternally vigilant that we do not mistake an aspect of our own condition that is unique to us for one that is universal and therefore a part of the human condition. A differentiation can be made, in many cases — there are &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; implications in what it means to be a thinking, conscious, curious, reasoning agent with a limited experience of the world, which has desires and must interact with the world in such a way as to bring them about — but doing that differentiation is far more difficult than any mathematical one, and far more prone to error. Thus the normative philosopher must proceed carefully, cautiously, and with a steady eye towards phenomenology and epistemology, and must always make their conclusions tentative. This is the core difficulty in diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The secondary challenge in the work of a normative philosopher is obvious: the challenge of prescription. It is often thought that once a problem is made clear, its solution is likewise made obvious. This is wishful thinking. Even the most clearly described problem may be intractable or even insoluble. Conversely, sometimes, a problem is not a problem at all: the problem only presents itself because of a deeper mistake in assumptions, expectations, or knowledge, and once that deeper problem is solved, the other problem will dissipate like the vapor it was. Furthermore, the solution to a certain problem might precisely lie in the fact that there is no set solution, that a solution must be generated by the will of each of us, and this might be done in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus the diagnosis of and prescription for the human condition’s ailments is a fearsome task, and it may seem vain — both in the sense of narcissism, and in the sense of being doomed to failure — to embark on it; all the moreso for one like myself. Nevertheless, it is a worthy cause. I, like any good doctor, cannot see a patient — all of humanity in my case — so wracked by pain and sorrow and yet turn away from at least attempting treatment. And make no mistake: the human condition is painful and sorrowful by nature. Many have found anesthetics for this pain, but few have found true solutions, and when they do those solutions are invariably too specific to be of general application. I want to present, as best I can, the first few steps on the long path of thought which, I hope, might lead to a true solution more general, unified, and effective than the ones which humans forced to live life and find a way through it have found but not shared or failed to share. It will be constructed from the pieces of prescriptions offered by philosophers before me, and things pulled from my own mind and experience; however, it is all so blended together in my embryonic system that to attempt to cite and quote where each idea has been pulled from would be an exercise in futility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-the-method-of-determining-universal-facts-of-the-human-condition&quot;&gt;2. The Method of Determining Universal Facts of the Human Condition&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first question of the diagnostician must be: what are the facts concerning this patient which I am to be diagnosing? Therefore if I am to diagnose the human condition, in a like manner I must first understand the facts about it. In other words, I must somehow gain access to facts that are true of the condition of all humans, since “the human condition” is an abstraction, a collective noun, for the condition of all individual humans. This will necessarily be a smaller set of facts than the facts about any individual human condition, just as the facts that are true of an abstraction from many particulars are never as numerous as the facts that are true of a given particular, because some of the true facts concerning those particulars must vary between them — to differentiate them and hence &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; them particulars — and the facts that amongst the set must be left out of the description of the entire set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this I can conclude that the facts which are true of my own human condition are a superset of the facts that are true of &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; human condition. The rest of the methodology for abstraction described above, however, is unfortunately pretty much useless. After all, we do not have access to the internal phenomenological facts of other human beings. We have access only to our own phenomena. Therefore, I must, as I described in the introduction, proceed by a different route: instead of attempting to document the facts of as many particular human conditions as I can discover, and draw up an abstraction from that, I must instead begin with my own particular human condition, and discover what truths concerning it are &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; products of being a being like myself and which are products of my situatedness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key question, therefore, is how to differentiate the two categories of facts. I propose that the basis of this differentiation should still be observation. Instead of observing all the categories of facts that are true of the internal phenomenological experience of the human condition of every individual human being, and then sifting through that list to find the common facts, I will instead observe the external existence of human beings, and compare it to my own external existence. Then, on the basis of conceptual analysis of the necessary implications of such an external existence and an analysis of the correspondences between aspects of &lt;em&gt;my own&lt;/em&gt; external existence and interior experience, I can determine what shared properties can be found between my interior experience and that of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-the-facts-of-the-human-condition&quot;&gt;3. The Facts of the Human Condition&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;31-consciousness-and-thrownness&quot;&gt;3.1. Consciousness and Thrownness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary fact of human existence seems to be that of our subjectivity: our awareness as subjects perceiving objects. Without this awareness, there would be no content to our experience or existence, no components with which to compose thoughts or anything else. We would, in essence, not exist as conscious beings at all, because to be conscious is to be conscious &lt;em&gt;of something&lt;/em&gt;. Without awareness of objects, it would be impossible to perform any task, including writing this essay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, however, there is a split in this consciousness. For, while human subjectivity can serve as its own object — in what we call self-awareness or introspection — there must be subjectivity there in the first place to be aware of, and for subjectivity to be present, there must be an object to be aware of. Hence, without grounding the chain of introspection in a first step where subjective awareness is aware of an object that is not itself, we cannot begin the process of introspection, because there is no subjectivity to ever form the object of further subjective awareness in the first place. Without subjective awareness of external objects, there would be nothing to be aware of internally, when we turn our subjectivity on itself as its own object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; basic fact of our own human existence is not merely our awareness of objects of consciousness in general, but specifically our awareness of external objects. Everything else — introspection and self-awareness — is built upon that foundation and makes no sense without it. This means that the fundamental fact of human existence is our embeddedness in a larger world that is outside our direct control by means of thought. The first and most important thing about humans is that we are thrust into a world we have no choice but to perceive and interact with — our unavoidable thrownness (&lt;em&gt;Geworfenheit&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;32-the-second-fact-dual-consciousness&quot;&gt;3.2. The Second Fact: Dual Consciousness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the first fact, a new fact emerges: there is a foundational split in human consciousness between direct subjectivity, which is conscious merely of external objects, and indirect subjectivity, which is conscious of itself and of itself being conscious in turn of other things. The former part of consciousness is the egoistic layer (or mode) of consciousness, and the latter the narrative layer (or mode). It is still the same apparatus of subjectivity that is being used for both, so these layers are not strictly separate but instead are two modes of the same thing, but it is useful to think of them as layers (that are, nevertheless, interwoven into a moebius strip of feedback loops), as the two modes of subjectivity occur nearly simultaneously when they are both in play and rapidly switch back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first component of consciousness is where our motivations and deepest desires come from: the direct awareness of pleasure and pain and states of the world, the immediate communion with surrounding facts. It is also what generates impulses to act pursuant of these deeply held desires — not merely in reflexes, as one might mistakenly think, but in more complex actions as well. This is the consciousness that we have when totally focused on a single task, whether it be swimming or a game of chess. It is the component of consciousness driven purely to achieve desires by any means possible — the egoistic layer of consciousness. This is the layer that humans most share with the other animals, although we have a much more complex and powerful version of it because of our capacity for language and reasoning. This is the sort of awareness that we have when our ability for self-reflection is (usually temporarily) stripped from us, in intense situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second component of consciousness is the layer that watches other layers as an object — the process that occurs when subjectivity is turned upon itself. The second layer sees the first layer (and itself) as objects that are as foreign and external, in a sense, as any other external object, since that is the necessary product of the alienating subject-object relation, and attempts to draw conclusions about them and meld them into a single cohesive theory about the self. It, essentially, tries to weave all the facts of its existence into a single cohesive whole, so as to portray itself as a single, consistent entity which endures through time and change. This is, in a sense, a fiction, but in a sense a truth, as the brain and body that is identical with the human being does persist through time as a single object. This layer weaves a narrative that is as true as it is false, a story to tell itself about itself and what it is, its history, impulses, actions, and desires. This is, therefore, a layer that is fundamentally &lt;em&gt;narrative&lt;/em&gt; and abductive in nature, because it does not have perfect access to the lower layer. It cannot actually perceive its own deepest desires, the ones held in the egoistic layer, and so instead must make guesses as to what its desires are through past feelings and impulses to action. This is why people can be wrong about what they desire: what they desire happens at a deeper level than the operation that attempts to examine and explicate this desire, and is out of its reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The narrative process also examines the objects of experience that the egoistic process takes in, by noticing that the egoistic process is perceiving things and understanding what it is perceiving, and attempts to integrate them into the narrative story that it is telling about itself as a conscious entity. Each object of experience thereby acquires a “meaning” or “purpose” relative to the agent. This feature of the narrative process will be discussed in more detail later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is only through the second layer that more complex reasoning can occur, as one examines one’s own thought processes for correctness and consciously mulls over and integrates what one knows. It is also only due to the narrative layer that human beings are capable of planning, by viewing themselves as an object which can be hypothetically divorced from the self doing the thinking and given different properties (greater age, hunger, etc) and then placed into hypothetical situations. It is also this second layer which allows the deeper communication with others of explaining thoughts and emotional states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These layers, as I said earlier, are not strictly separate, however. The egoistic process that happens at the lower layer of consciousness receives some of its plans for action and desires from the analysis that the narrative process performs, and the narrative process only runs at the behest of the desires of the egoistic process, just like everything else in the human body besides the autonomic systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;33-thought&quot;&gt;3.3. Thought&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After mere awareness, or observation, of an object of consciousness comes thought. The connection between the two — awareness and thought — is often so close that the two are confused for each other, yet they are not one and the same. As those skilled in meditating will tell you, and your own occasional experience will likely confirm, it is possible to be truly and totally aware of an object without thinking anything about it. Likewise, it is possible to have fewer or more numerous thoughts concerning an object of awareness, demonstrating the separation between the two. Nevertheless, the two are also closely related: thoughts concerning objects are generated automatically from the awareness of an object. Awareness takes place in both the egoistic and narrative processes of consciousness (because consciousness is defined by the awareness of things, no matter what process or layer it is), whereas thought occurs only in the narrative process, because only in the narrative process is it possible to analyze objects of experience at an distanced, abstract level, and think about things in relation to oneself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a thought is generated in the narrative process, in relation to some object of perception, that thought itself can become an object of perception for the narrative process as it turns on itself, and since whenever the narrative process perceives or is aware of anything it generates thoughts related to that thing, when this thought becomes an object of the narrative processes’ perception, it automatically generates a new thought. These thoughts are related by subject, or by logical or probabilistic entailment. These thoughts are then also integrated into the narrative that this process is constructing about itself as a single cohesive entity — and when thoughts cannot be so integrated, such as with intrusive thoughts, it is jarring and even psychologically distressing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, this process of thought generation is not “volitional.” One does not choose what one thinks: one must follow one’s own inner logic from one thought to the next, must follow the clear truth of the thoughts derived from awareness. One can choose to “think something” in the sense of conjuring a random phrase in the mind, but one cannot choose what one thinks is true, right, what follows from one’s thoughts. There is volition in the human subject that is an indelible component of our experience — whatever metaphysical truth undergirds it — but it is not to be found here. &lt;strong&gt;The domain of thought is the domain of a mechanical process for the production and weaving of more thoughts; a thinking person, if they pay attention carefully, will realize that they are being carried along helplessly by the flow.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;34-desire&quot;&gt;3.4. Desire&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next fundamental fact of the human condition is desire. This is perhaps the most important component from a practical standpoint, as desire is the source of all suffering and all fulfillment, and thereby source of the normative force of any advice or ethical judgment that could be given. Desire is that impulse, instinct, inclination, or sense of value in virtue of which choices are made and experiences evaluated. Desire is a fundamental part of the human existence because all of our existence requires choice. The choices of what to focus our awareness on, the choice to act in order to preserve our lives (or not), how to act, and even the choice not to think. Choice is inescapable. As Sartre said, we are “condemned to be free.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of subjectivity is selective — there is intentionality to human perception, thought, and awareness, we are not simply passive receivers of all of the available sensory information, nor is our sensory apparatus omnidirectional and impartial — there must be some factor which directs our sensory apparatus and limits, within the range of sensory input it gives us, what we are primarily aware of. Desire is what performs this function: it is our current paramount desires that determine how we direct our subjective awareness (towards what and in what scope), and what objects of that awareness are most immediately sensed and seen as relevant. Thus, under normal conditions, we perceive objects that are relevant to our desires first, and these only insofar as they help or hinder desires, and only in their capacity as tools or obstacles. We view things, under normal conditions, therefore, in terms of purpose or goal: what is the purpose of this object to me? How does this object relate to my goal? Everything else forms a paler backdrop, which we do perceive, but is mostly filtered out of conscious, active interest and awareness, and almost entirely filtered out of the process of automatic thought generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We even perceive ourselves only when we ourselves are tools or obstacles to our own progress toward desired ends, which is why embarrassment is such a good tool for inducing self-consciousness: suddenly our very existence in that moment of embarrassment becomes a hindrance to our goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is only when some oddity startles us that we fall out of this mode of thinking. When our desire changes from goals embedded in the world, to meta-goals: goals about our goals or goals about our thinking. It is only when my goal shifts from whatever mundane task is before me currently to perceiving the world around me that suddenly I see every object in perfect clarity, as itself, instead of as a tool or obstacle. Even then, I am still seeing every object in relation to a desire; it is merely that the desire has changed, and so perception of the objects as honestly as I am capable of perceiving them is now the best way they can serve as a tool, and every object can thus serve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, we only view people as more than complex and volatile tools worthy of careful interaction and respect in order to get what we want out of them when our emotions suddenly well up in us and jar us out of such thinking. Again, however, this is because the goal has changed; empathy or compassion has made my goal to see this person as a being like myself, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like for thought, there is no volition at the roots of desire. Some desires — some set of desires or some single desire — must form the concrete foundation for all our other desires, for, to choose a desire, I must have a desire regarding what desires I have, in order to have a basis for that choice. Thus if all desires were volitional, there would be an infinite regress of them, an infinite regress that is impossible to resolve in a finite mind and finite time. This implies that, to be as happy as possible, the first task of every human being is to discover these immutable desires. These base level desires must be accommodated, because they themselves cannot accommodate anything else. They are also the ones most deeply and powerfully felt, as they provide the justification for all other things, all other thoughts, choices, and desires. But, again, we will discuss this later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say “discover” in the foregoing paragraph because, by default, the desires inherent in our minds are unarticulated and hidden from our understanding, manifest at the egoistic layer of consciousness. We are not directly aware of our desires at all — we are merely aware, after the fact, of whether something we did satisfied a desire or not. There is a reward mechanism embedded in the egoistic layer of consciousness, as I have said before, which doles out pleasure and pain in accordance with its nature. There is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a table of articulated and specific desires written in language on our minds. That &lt;em&gt;could not be the case&lt;/em&gt;, because humans are not born with the capacity for language, and our motive power in desires needed to exist before we even had the capability of learning language. Any conscious sense of the desire that we have is a reconstruction performed by the narrative layer of consciousness, as it observes after the fact the whole history of rewards and punishments that the egoistic layer of consciousness doles out, and tries to reason out its best guess at what the the whole being wants inductively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, then, we can think of human perception as a series of consecutive filters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First, we receive sensory information, the direction, range, and depth of which is mediated by the desires present in the egoistic layer of consciousness.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Next, our brain parses these sensory inputs into an intelligible array of objects and entities, focused around what objects we can pick up or manipulate, since those objects are the ones most likely to be candidates for satisfying our desires.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After that, our brain uses the set of our most prominent and active desires at that moment to filter the list of objects most present and vivid in our awareness down to the ones that are directly relevant to the satisfaction of our desires or the hindrance thereof, and invest them with the relevant “metadata” concerning how they relate to us, our desires, and their context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, although desires are primarily a phenomenon of the egoistic layer of consciousness, what we know in the narrative layer of consciousness, in terms of the context of these objects, their relation to ourselves and others, our past experiences of the objects, and our knowledge about the use of those objects, is relevant to the selection of what subset of the perceived objects get primarily presented to conscious awareness, so our consciousness must switch into its narrative mode of operation concerning almost every object which passes the first two filters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, since the narrative and egoistic layers of consciousness are more &lt;em&gt;modes&lt;/em&gt; of operation for a single entity than separate entities which can call to each other with specific and delimited requests, this switch in order to consult what the narrative layer knows concerning every object in our awareness brings with it the rest of its method of processing, meaning that other memories about objects (or considerations of their meaning and relation to ourselves, etc.) that are not directly relevant to the object’s use to us in satisfying or hindering desires, are often brought into our awareness. This will be important later in my analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;35-temporal-existence&quot;&gt;3.5. Temporal Existence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dual nature of consciousness also reveals the essentially temporal, and temporally interlinked, nature of human consciousness. After all, if subjectivity exists only when given an object, and subjectivity must already exist for it to serve as its own object, then we are faced with a question: how is self-reflection possible at all? For, if we turn the attention of the subject away from an external object and toward itself, does it not cease to exist in that very moment, and therefore cease to be a possible subject for itself? The solution to this question is simple: memory. When we turn our awareness upon itself, we are not turning it upon its current self, but upon the awareness &lt;em&gt;just past&lt;/em&gt; and preserved for us in memory. Thus all self-reflection is actually past-reflection; the delay is only so brief that it matters little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desire, like self-awareness, is also a necessarily temporal component of human experience: it is al ways oriented toward something which is not, at present, possessed or fulfilled, and since the human being is forever being thrust forward through time, the only temporal epoch in which it is possible to satisfy a desire is the future. It is only in the future of the desire that one may act, and only in the future of that action when a change in the state of the world toward the desired one can be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;36-the-desire-for-meaning&quot;&gt;3.6. The Desire For Meaning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The human world is full of meaning, richly embroidered into the fabric of everything that we experience in the same way that desire is, &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of desire, as explained in &lt;strong&gt;section 3.4&lt;/strong&gt;. Upon turning our attention onto any given thing, thoughts spring up in our narrative consciousness as it is consulted concerning that thing. When this happens, the narrative process cannot help but weave that object into a story in relation to ourselves, our character, and our history, instead of simply serving up the information needed for the rich perceptual apparatus to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I see a chair, it is difficult to see it except in the context of the other chairs I have known, the purpose I know the chair is meant to serve, how I have used the chair in the past,  who uses the chair normally and my relation to them (or whether I am that person), etc, because all these things effect how my rich perceptual apparatus should present it to me, if it should present it at all. Even the word — chair — is associated with the object and with the necessary context that establishes that that word refers to this object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also impossible to perceive any object except as it relates to oneself — spatially, temporally, in likeness and unlikeness. Try, for instance, imagining a chair that has no relation to oneself — not a certain distance away, not a certain relative size. Just a chair. It is impossible. In the mind’s eye, just as in reality, any conception of an object of awareness is necessarily in relation to oneself. Similarly, but on a more abstact level, moreover, I also become “the person who saw that chair”, and the narrative consciousness notes that “&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; saw a chair today,” even if these entries into its running narrative are short-lived and quickly forgotten. This is part of the involutnary, constitutive task of the narrative layer of consciousness: to document and understand &lt;em&gt;who I am&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence each object is a vortex of purpose, relation, context, story, and memory. This is what we call “meaning.” An object has meaning when we can understand it in terms of all these things, and weave it into a coherent and intelligible narrative about ourselves and our character and history. That is what makes a symbol or a word meaningful — its relation to an intersubjective ability to communicate a concept and its relation to real things in the world — and it is what makes a person, object, or experience meaningful too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only time where there is a complete absence of meaning in the human experience is when there is no meaning to be had: no knowledge of context or purpose or history. Upon encountering a foreign object, there is a wrenching sense of unfamiliarity, as we for the first time encounter an object in the world &lt;em&gt;as it is&lt;/em&gt;, without the mediating buffer of context. This is also the experience one can have when looking at images intended to simulate the experience of stroke victims, where everything seems real and familiar, but nothing &lt;em&gt;makes sense&lt;/em&gt;. It has all lost its meaning. Some can train their minds to produce this effect at will, by changing their desires to those of seeing things devoid of context (this works because all awareness is mediated by desire), but this is not the default state of humanity, or even of the individuals capable of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meaning isn’t just a component of the human experience, however. It is a desired component. There is a term in the egoistic layer of consciousness’s reward function which motivates us to run the narrative layer of consciousness, with its attendant commitment to assigning meaning to everything, at all. Why is this, besides the necessity to do this for perceptual reasons? It is because, without meaning — without understanding relation and context and history and desire — action is ineffective, dangerous, and impossible, and therefore achieving desire becomes more difficult as well. Seeing meaning in objects in the world is a necessary condition for effectively achieving any desire at all, and therefore it itself is desired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This becomes all the more apparent when we switch our focus from individual objects to relations between objects or temporal events. In these, a new component of meaning can be found: pattern. Pattern is found in the likeness between multiple objects, which forms the basis for abstraction and therefore ontological induction — the application of previous knowledge of objects to future similar objects — or in the likeness between multiple temporal occurrences, forming the basis for temporal induction, leading to natural laws and cause and effect. These kinds of meaning, existing in the relations between objects, are even more crucial to action and therefore the satisfaction of desire, and thus the desire to finding patterns in things is even stronger for the human being. So strong, in fact, that we often find ourselves finding patterns in things where there are, in fact, no patterns at all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the crucial components of human consciousness is its ability to become an object of its own subjectivity, to turn the apparatus of perceptual awareness on itself and inspect its own Being. What does that look like, when the perceptual apparatus is richly imbued with meaning gleaned from the conscious subject itself? Well, when we turn this richly meaning-infused apparatus on itself, we are naturally led to ask questions concerning our relationship to something, our context, our relation to the satisfaction of some set of desires, our purpose according to something. This is what we are referring to when we say “what is the meaning of life (for me)?” The natural “something” that those relations and desires and purposes should be set relative to is of course ourself, as is the case when we look at external objects; after all, that is how the process of narrative-layer meaning-imbuing works in all other cases: it asks “what is the relation of this object to &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, what is its purpose to &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, how does it help or hinder &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; goals?” Yet, because we are &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to looking at an object’s meaning with respect to something external to the object — because when we look at external objects, their meaning comes from us, an object ourselves external to that object — when we look at ourselves as an object, we can sometimes make the mistake of looking for our relation to &lt;em&gt;something else&lt;/em&gt;, our purpose &lt;em&gt;to something else&lt;/em&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the natural problem becomes — what something else is to provide this externally-sourced meaning to ourselves viewed as objects? This can become family, friends, communities, or causes, but as often as not it is deities or dictators. After all, that something else was supposed to be ourselves, a conscious personal agent, so the most natural something else to fill that role, if we are looking outside ourselves, is another conscious personal agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is a misapplication of the meaning-imbuing process, which was built to, and when correctly applied only does, consider things in relation to ourselves. Thus, from a perceptual standpoint this looking for meaning ourside ourselves is a mistake, a bug in our source code. Not only that, but it is harmful, too. If we seek for meaning ourside ourselves and our own existences, we subbordinate our own narrative about ourselves and our character, our own choice about who we will be, what we think, and how to act, to the greater narrative of something other than ourselves, and this process causes us, over time, to lose our unique and individual identity, our ability to stand on our own outside of that external, stifling narrative and choose our own meaning and morality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what causes nihlism, what eats away at the core of humanity, the weakness that religion preys on and breeds: the increase of this mistake, this fluke in our perceptual system, that makes us seek meaning outside ourselves and depend on another, on something else, which can come to supplant our identities, our strengths, our individuality and autonomy. This is why you see Christians spout the idea that without Jesus, they are nothing, and their whole lives are defined in terms of Jesus, the Cross, the Church: their identities have rotten away, if they ever grew to begin with, under the smothering hand of their Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the question of the meaning of life arises, and because of a common (and encouraged) error, it causes suffering, subordination, and destruction of the self. I will explore this in more detail later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;37-action-and-will-free-and-otherwise&quot;&gt;3.7. Action and Will (“Free” and Otherwise)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I have been enumerating facts about the human condition which are primarily focused on its perceptual and experiential aspects. These are important, but they are not the whole story. As important as consciousness and experience are to human existence, action is equally necessary, if temporally and logically subordinate. Action is a necessary condition for human Being, just as perception is a necessary condition for both human Being and human action itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human action is the conscious application of means (elements of the environment and one’s own body and time) towards desired ends (states of the world or the self) according to some plan (constructed in the narrative consciousness of the human being).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human action is necessarily temporal on all levels, in the same way desire is. One acts because one desires to achieve some end in the future, because it is not now already achieved. Likewise, the process of constructing a plan, &lt;em&gt;choosing&lt;/em&gt; to act and what action to take, is also a temporal affair. There is a time in the consciousness when one does not know what action one will choose, and so, epistemologically, any action that seriously occurs to one at that moment seems equally likely — or at least, roughly so, even if, in actuality, a single choice is predetermined by all the factors involved. One must then go through a process of reasoning and choice in order to uncover which choice one is to make. This is why I phrase the process of choosing as a process of “uncovering”: the choice is already guaranteed, by the nature of your mind, your knowledge, and your environment, but it has not yet been arrived at, in the same way that the final motion of a Rube Goldberg machine is ensured and predetermined by the construction of the machine once it is set in motion, but it is not actually arrived at, known (except perhaps by the designer), or completed until the machine has actually gone through the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, human beings, in order to choose a plan of action, must represent choices to themselves as serious options which they &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; choose, in order to go through  the process of weighing the options and choosing one — even if this is done irrationally and in a split-second, and even if this is merely an epistemological fiction. Otherwise, the choice would already have to be made. In this way, we must phenomenologically and epistemologically ignore determinism in order to make choices at all. This is where people get the misconception of “free will” from: they think that because each option, before a choice is made, appears &lt;em&gt;epistemologically&lt;/em&gt; equally likely, because of a lack of information, they are actually &lt;em&gt;probabilistically&lt;/em&gt; equally likely, such that any one of them could &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; have been selected given the entire history of the world, and if time were rewound and the choice run again, a different choice could have been made. This is a classic confusion between Bayesian probability and frequentist probability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I state so confidently that free will does not exist, that all our choices are determined, because the concept of free will is inherently incoherent — a signifier that signifies no meaningful and distinct concept. Indeterminate effect (random chance) and determined effect are mutually exhaustive and mutually exclusive: an outcome is &lt;em&gt;either&lt;/em&gt; specified by the history of the world up until that point (determined), &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; there are possible worlds in which the history of the world was identical and yet the outcome was different, and therefore the history of the world does not specify the outcome (indeterminate). Libertarian free will is obviously incompatible with the first option, and neither is it compatible with the second. A choice is not “free” if it is fully determined by the past, but neither is it “free” if it is merely made on the basis of a causeless, perfectly random set of metaphysical dice, because in the sense of “free” that proponents of libertarian free will seem to mean, a free choice must be both determined in some crucial way by the character, history, and environment of the agent, and yet not fully determined by these factors, and yet not random either, but &lt;em&gt;volitional&lt;/em&gt;, whatever that means. They want to take incompatible, contradictory aspects from the two actual options in an attempt to sew them together into a Frankenstein’s monster of a third option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, and I reiterate this point because it is crucial, the fact that the choice one will make is predetermined from the outset does not negate either the true appearance of free will when making choices — and the vertiginous sense of freedom therein — nor the fact that one actually must go through a process of reasoning to discover what that foregone choice actually is. When a waiter asks you what you would like for dinner, you don’t say “let’s wait and see.” Moreover, because this choice is &lt;em&gt;in fact&lt;/em&gt; determined, even if it does not appear so, that means it stems in equal parts from one’s character (mind, personality, learned traits, inherited traits, all that makes up the specific nature of a person and makes them valuable or not, good or not), what one knows, and the environment around one. Therefore, the process of choice is a process of uncovering, but also simultaneously constituting and concretizing, &lt;em&gt;who one is&lt;/em&gt; in that moment. Am I the sort of person who will do X? Or Y?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The narrative component of consciousness does not just weave the choice itself, and all that says about one’s character, into its tapestry, however. It weaves in the meta-choices and assumptions involved in the choice: beliefs about the permissibility of that action, and other similar actions in relevantly similar cases, abstracted out as reason and empathy demand; beliefs about what states of the world are more or less valuable and how those values weigh in comparison to the actions taken. None of this is avoidable, and to attempt to ignore it is, as Sartre called it, “bad faith.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how moral responsibility, inasmuch as it is at all coherent, can be compatible with determinism: when an actor takes an action, there is a &lt;em&gt;particular actor&lt;/em&gt; that did so, and hence a locus of causation where many millions of causes are woven into one particular outcome that is the unique producer of such an outcome and therefore the most important step in the causal chain from the environment to the action. No environmental or historical factor of an individual guarantees that any other individual would, when placed in the same position, have done the same thing. Therefore, it is the individual themself that makes the crucial difference, even if the environment and history of the actor plays a part. Just as we say that it is the spark that caused the explosion at the gas station, even though it needed all the gas to be there, because the spark is the unique element that made the difference between &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; gas station and all the other ones, so we can say that a particular individual caused the results of their actions because they are the unique and particular element that led to that result. And insofar as their actions &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; in fact guaranteed by their environment, such that no other individual could have helped but to act in the same way (say, through mind control or extreme coercive threats), then we should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; hold them responsible, because it was not that particular, instantiated, physical, real person that was the deciding factor after all, but the person or persons who guaranteed that they would act in that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, when an action is taken, there is a &lt;em&gt;particular actor&lt;/em&gt; that is affirming a set of propositions about what is valuable and what is permissible; no one else inherently subscribes to those thoughts because of that action except that particular actor, even if what that actor does is completely determined by their environment and history, and no innate qualities (which is not true anyway). Therefore, there is an identifiable person that has decided that such actions were permissible, along with the consequences to them and threat (or benefit) to the community that that entails. And if there were other actors that manipulated their history and environment knowingly, in order to produce that set of beliefs, then they held those beliefs about value and permissible actions as well, and are therefore on the hook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, not only are humans, when we act, responsible for uncovering what sort of persons we are through our choices and actions, and the assumed beliefs implied by them, we are responsible for our actions ourselves, as the unique loci of causation that generate them. We are what determines are choices, so if anything we are &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; responsible for our choices and actions, given determinism, than if given libertarian free will. After all, given determinism, our actions and choices are fully implied by who and what we are and where we are, they flow from the intimately sensed realities of our situation, and should feel (as they do, at least for me) natural and inevitable after we make them. While, on the other hand, given libertarian free will, our choices and actions are only partly determined by the intimately felt realities of our existence, and partly by something else that is nebulous and Other, and therefore would feel alien to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this first part of a three part series on my particular take on existentialist philosophy and normative philosophy — unified with egoism and eudaimonism —  I discussed several topics. First, I discussed the need for this kind of philosophy, and why it is one of the last forms of useful philosophy there are. Second, I discussed my methodology, as it exists in a sort of comparative dialogue between my own experiences and their correlations with outside manifestation, and the input and manifestation of the human beings around me. Third, I explained the seven basic facts of the human experience: the fact that humans are thrown into an existence that they have no say in, and that experience of this existence constitutes our existence and consciousness; that consciousness is split into two layers which it alternates between in a complex feedback loop process, the narrative and egoistic layers; that thought is a necessary corollary of perception for human beings thanks to the existence of the narrative layer of consciousness; that desire is the mediator of all experience and conceptualization of the world around us, and that there must be some base set of fixed desires; the fact that humans exist through time; the fact that humans desire meaning, to weave the things around them into a narrative that is whole and unified and sensical; and finally, the fact that humans must act to exist, and that this action implies a sense of free will that is a denial and negation of determinism, while also a sense of responsibility that is an affirmation of it, and the implied self-reflecting assumptions of such action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next essay, I will dive deeper into how all of these facts come into play in order to produce a core conflicts in the human experience which is the source of our existential suffering. In the essay after that, I will show how solving these core conflicts can bring happiness to even the worst of lives — although it is not in itself sufficient for complete happiness — and ensure more fruitful lives and compassionate and harmonious relationships with others, as well as attempt to sketch out just such a solution.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alexis</name></author><category term="existentialism" /><category term="human-being" /><summary type="html">“Everything has been figured out, except how to live.” — Satre</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Synthesis Libertarianism: A Manifesto</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2021/10/09/synthesis.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Synthesis Libertarianism: A Manifesto" /><published>2021-10-09T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-10-09T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2021/10/09/synthesis</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2021/10/09/synthesis.html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-introduction&quot;&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been an invisible war for the heart and soul of the libertarian movement going on since the 1960s, and corruption is winning. The foundational values of libertarianism have been all but lost in the influx of alt-right and neo-reactionary people, and something must finally be done about it lest we lose  those values completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thin libertarianism was the naive dream of a tiny and struggling movement striving to grow at all costs, but what does it matter if the movement grows, if the movement dies and becomes something else in the process? We need to take back “right” libertarianism. The purpose of this manifesto, then, is to establish a core set of foundational values which libertarians must share to have a consistent basis for their libertarianism, values that, we will show, are fundamentally incompatible with neo-reactionaries and the alt-right. Libertarian beliefs can be arrived at from other foundations, but a libertarianism thus conceived will be fundamentally at war with itself at best, and insincere at worst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This manifesto will focus not on specific conclusions, but instead on the values of the movement, because to do otherwise would turn this into an exercise in gatekeeping and thought-control, rendering our project merely an exercise in cult-building not unlike Objectivism or Austro-Libertarianism and thereby giving birth to nothing new and useful. It should be noted, however, that this focus on values and their consistent application has very broad implications — this is not a thin libertarianism 2.0. We will focus here primarily on the social aspects of this broadening, but values are applicable in a broad variety of cases, so setting out a list of them may have implications outside both politics and social interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we are trying to rescue “right” libertarianism from its right-wing infiltrators, it might seem odd that we are, in the process, seeking to rename it. However, consider this: if the values that make “right” libertarianism unique are incompatible with the rest of the right-wing, is it truly valid to call it right wing? Moreover, since the values of “right” libertarianism actually most naturally lead it to embrace certain leftist social — and even economic — values, what better way to express that this libertarianism is a fusion of some economically right-wing ideas and some economically and socially left-wing ideas than to give it a name representative of such a synthesis?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following document, we will briefly outline what these values are that libertarians as a movement must hold, and why they lead both to a respect for stricter property rights and social leftism and egalitarianism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-the-values-of-libertarianism&quot;&gt;2. The Values of Libertarianism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most obvious “libertarian value” is, of course, liberty. This is made evident by the very etymology of the name of the movement. There are, however, many different conceptions of liberty: positive, negative, individual, collective, social, atomistic, and more; hence specifying the precise concept of liberty meant when the word is used is far more important than simply saying you value liberty. Almost every post-Enlightenment political philosophy, even the authoritarian ones, claims to bring liberty, by some definition or another, to the political organization and its members, and it is the precise definition that makes the difference between the different political philosophies. If Marxism, fascism, and libertarianism all claim to bring liberty,  liberty means very little by itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, what specific definition you give to liberty, and the focus that one places on it relative to other values, depends on deeper, more foundational values. So, as simple as it might seem to claim that liberty, or even individual liberty, is the core value of the libertarian movement, I think it is necessary to delve deeper into its foundations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, I will try to locate the deepest foundation of the libertarian value-set, and then build up from there, thus showing how the specific definition of liberty that libertarians use develops from that deeper foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;21-individual-self-determination&quot;&gt;2.1. Individual Self-Determination&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first value that libertarians must hold in order to have a secure foundation for other libertarian beliefs and values is that of individual self-determination: the necessity and desirability of individual human beings applying their own minds and situated knowledge to the particular conditions around them in order to solve problems and achieve goals. This value may be held both because it sustains and makes possible the flourishing of human beings, and because it is the best method of creating a dynamic, creative, and efficient society. A few quotes will serve to substantiate that this is a common libertarian belief:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Since men can think, feel, evaluate, and act only as individuals, it becomes vitally necessary for each man’s survival and prosperity that he be free to learn, choose, develop his faculties, and act upon his knowledge and values. This is the necessary path of human nature; to interfere with and cripple this process by using violence goes profoundly against what is necessary by man’s nature for his life and prosperity. Violent interference with a man’s learning and choices is therefore profoundly “antihuman”; it violates the natural law of man’s needs.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Since knowledge, thinking, and rational action are properties of the individual, since the choice to exercise his rational faculty or not depends on the individual, man’s survival requires that those who think be free of the interference of those who don’t. Since men are neither omniscient nor infallible, they must be free to agree or disagree, to cooperate or to pursue their own independent course, each according to his own rational judgment. Freedom is the fundamental requirement of man’s mind.” &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“He who lets the world, or his own portion of it, choose his plan of life for him, has no need of any other faculty than the ape-like one of imitation… he requires and exercises [uniquely human qualities] exactly in proportion as the part of his conduct which he determines according to his own judgment and feelings is a large one. It is possible that he might be guided in some good path, and kept out of harm’s way, without any of these [qualities]. But what will be his comparative worth as a human being? It really is of importance, not only what men do, but also what manner of men they are that do it. Among the works of man, which human life is rightly employed in perfecting and beautifying, the first in importance surely is man himself.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“If we can agree that the economic problem of society is mainly one of rapid adaptation to changes in the particular circumstances of time and place, it would seem to follow that the ultimate decisions must be left to the people who are familiar with these circumstances, who know directly of the relevant changes and of the resources immediately available to meet them. We cannot expect that this problem will be solved by first communicating all this knowledge to a central board which, after integrating all knowledge, issues its orders. We must solve it by some form of decentralization.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why must this value be held? Because all human beings value the welfare of themselves and, to a lesser degree, other human beings; furthermore, all human beings care about the wealth and health of their society, as this influences their ability to achieve what they desire. Therefore, if one were to believe that freedom to exercise one’s choices was unhealthy for human beings, not conducive to their flourishing, and deleterious to the health of society, then it would be impossible to consistently and enthusiastically support freedom. Moreover, it is the freedom to make one’s own choices that is characteristic of the specific liberty which libertarians endorse, as opposed to the freedom from want or worry or oppression or isolation or even exploitation which other theories of freedom and liberty value more highly. Of course, many of those things can individual self-determination, but it is also possible that the use of one’s reasoning can make oneself worried, wanting, exploited, or isolated, and if this is the product of one’s free choice, then it is a part of liberty and its corollary, responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;22-consistency-and-equality&quot;&gt;2.2. Consistency and Equality&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another value of primary importance in the libertarian project, one which is necessary to provide a firm foundation for all the beliefs characteristic of those who partake in the movement, is that of consistency or universalizability. A libertarian desires not just individual self-determination (from here on, simply “liberty”) for some individuals, but for all individuals equally. A libertarian also requires the same duties and responsibilities from everyone: everyone has an equal responsibility for the consequences of their own actions, both to themselves and others, and an equal duty to refrain from coercing others, short-circuiting their process of individual self-determination by a threat of violence or by the physical prevention of their choice of action. Libertarians should have, and desire, no gods, kings, or masters, and only accept authority insofar as it is bound by the same rules as everyone else. All human beings share the same essential moral properties: the capacity to use our own reasoning and knowledge, and the capacity to understand, follow, and knowingly violate moral principles. Libertarians recognize this, and realize that whatever reasoning can be given for the liberty of some humans, can be given for the liberty of all humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why the signature phrase of right libertarians, “taxation is theft,” exists — it is an application of the everyday moral standards and duties of the rest of humanity to the actions of the political class, and a judgement of what they do. This is also why social contract theory has been so important to the history of libertarianism, from Locke to Nozick: an account of how a state may be justified usually appeals to special powers, either granted by god or the collective, that allow some to act in ways that others may not; this is not satisfying to a libertarian, however, and so another account, an account that explains how the state could have arisen only from the common rights of man, must be found. Opinion concerning the success of such accounts is immaterial; the fact that such an account must be found if the state is to be justified in one’s mind is what is important to whether one is a libertarian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few quotes on this subject by various libertarians:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“‘Equality,’ in a human context, is a political term: it means equality before the law, the equality of fundamental, inalienable rights which every man possesses by virtue of his birth as a human being, and which may not be infringed or abrogated by man-made institutions, such as titles of nobility or the division of men into castes established by law, with special privileges granted to some and denied to others.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Equality of the general rules of law and conduct, however, is the only kind of equality conducive to liberty and the only equality which we can secure without destroying liberty. Not only has liberty nothing to do with any other sort of equality, but it is even bound to produce inequality in many respects.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Anarchists hold that morality must be upheld in all cases, and not abandoned whenever State actions are involved.  Men have long since rejected the Divine Right of Kings; surely it is now past time to do the same with all claims that the State is Extra-Human or Extra-Moral.  The State must be judged on the same level and by the same principles as all other human actions and institutions; one rule applies to all.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“If every person has the right to defend even by force — his person, his liberty, and his property, then it follows that a group of men have the right to organize and support a common force to protect these rights constantly… Thus, since an individual cannot lawfully use force against the person, liberty, or property of another individual, then the common force — for the same reason — cannot lawfully be used to destroy the person, liberty, or property of individuals or groups.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why, too, must this view be upheld if one is to be a consistent libertarian? This is perhaps a more complex answer, but it is nevertheless a very important one. The answer has three parts, the first of which I covered before the quotes, and I’ll cover the last two now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, because a system which grants liberty to some and not others simply does not resemble what anyone would call a libertarian system; one of the defining features of libertarianism is the fact that it applies the same logic to every single individual within a society, since it is an individualistic philosophy. A system which grants liberty to one class, but allows that class to limit the liberty of another class, is an aristocratic or otherwise authoritarian system, not a libertarian one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, if the goal is to maximize liberty, then it must be recognized that we must give each and every person the maximum amount of liberty possible, and an exercise of too great a liberty of one person lessens the liberty of another (if I steal from you, I gain the liberty to decide the fate of the object I steal, but you lose that liberty; indeed, you lose the further liberty of deciding what to do with the outcomes of your prior choices that are concretized in that item). Assigning a fully maximal amount of liberty to a few and a proportionally lesser amount to everyone else is not as viable an option, because the maximum amount of liberty one person is able to experience is not as great as the medium amount of liberty of several, and allowing anyone and everyone to violate the liberty of others is not going to solve the problem either, as generally the violation of liberty either simply transfers liberties from one person to another (thereby not increasing the total amount), or decreases the amount of freedom exercised overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which of these three rationales, or what combination of them, you find most important and convincing will depend on what your foundations for holding these values are, but the important point is that you must hold these values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;23-entitlement-theory-of-justice-in-holdings&quot;&gt;2.3. Entitlement Theory of Justice In Holdings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another distinguishing value of libertarianism as synthesis libertarianism seeks to encapsulate it is a certain, as Nozick termed it, entitlement theory of justice in holdings. In this view, any rights one has over something are determined by the historical story of that object: how it was originally produced or appropriated and how it was transferred. There are of course differing opinions on what exactly constitutes just original appropriation, what exactly constitutes just transfer, and what should happen should the full history of an object not be available or be tainted — as most land is — with historical injustice. But the fundamental value that libertarians all share is the view that justice is constituted in the nature of individual actions and intentions, not in the nature of outcomes, so to establish justice in holdings, as in all other things, one must look to the actions and intentions which generated that holding — the history of that holding. This is, in a sense, an outcome of the corollary of liberty I mentioned some time ago, responsibility, since the fundamental idea is that one has a just claim to a holding if it is the outcome of just actions on your part, and one has no such claim if it is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some further quotes to substantiate this as a libertarian view:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“[T]he right to property is a right to action, like all the others: it is not the right to an object, but to the action and the consequences of producing or earning that object. It is not a guarantee that a man will earn any property, but only a guarantee that he will own it if he earns it. It is the right to gain, to keep, to use and to dispose of material values.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:9&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:9&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“In contrast to end-result principles of justice, historical principles of justice hold that past circumstances or actions of people can create differential entitlements or differential deserts to things. An injustice can be worked by moving from one distribution to another structurally identical one, for the second, in profile the same, may violate people’s entitlements or deserts; it may not fit the actual history.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:10&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:10&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Therefore, we do not yet know which one of the two men is the legitimate or just property owner. We can only find the answer through investigating the concrete data of the particular case, i.e., through ‘historical’ inquiry. Thus, we cannot simply say that the great axiomatic moral rule of the libertarian society is the protection of property rights, period. For the criminal has no natural right whatever to the retention of prop­erty that he has stolen; the aggressor has no right to claim any property that he has acquired by aggression.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:11&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:11&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why must libertarians hold that private property, born out of the individual actions of people and determined in its justice by the justice of those originating actions, is a value that must be upheld? Again, first of all, it is simply a constituent property of what it means to be a libertarian in the sense that I have been using and in the sense that synthesis libertarianism is attempting to preserve; but secondly, it is because it is a necessary extension of the other principles so far. It is a construction of property which is based on the outcomes of individual actions within liberty, is equally applicable in its principles and rules to all people, and is necessary for people to preserve their own lives by their own hands and minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;24-proportionality&quot;&gt;2.4. Proportionality&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another component of libertarian value which is of primary importance is that of proportionality in justice. Although phrased barbarically, the old saying “an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth” really does sum up the libertarian approach to justice. A violation of someone’s liberty or property is to be met with a proportional, appropriate response, a violation in equal magnitude used either to prevent the violation from being consummated, or to produce restitution for a completed violation. This is what differentiates libertarians from other political philosophies in many ways: for instance, some progressives will advocate the use of the state — which operates on the basis of the threat of violence and kidnapping — to deal with violations of others that are not nearly so severe, even if they are undesirable: for instance, collusion to prevent someone from getting a job, or discrimination, or hate speech. These are undesirable things that actually violate the values I have previously outlined, but they are either the results of inaction on the part of the parties directly involved, or action that does not rise to the level of physical violence, and therefore to meet them with physical violence or the threat of it is a grossly disproportionate act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthemore, as part of making sense of this, it must be seen that the basis of whether something is a punishable crime is in the specific action that has been committed, and the extent to which it can be punished is in the specific action as well, as the punishment itself must be proportional to the action. Therefore, if no person or group was identifiably harmed, then harm cannot be done to a particular person or group in retaliation to that action in a proportional manner, because the action itself caused no harm to any particular person or group!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why even those libertarians who view the state as legitimate tend to view it as a necessary evil, or an institution which should be limited to making laws against crimes which are proportional to the severity of the powers which it leverages to enforce its laws. This is also why libertarians, although they are interested in historical justice, are opposed to collective punishment based on ancestry or group membership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few quotes will substantiate this point:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[quote on how it is wrong to use the law to enforce against things that are not themselves violent]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I propose another fundamental rule regard­ing crime: the criminal, or invader, loses his own right to the extent that he has deprived another man of his. If a man deprives another man of some of his self-ownership or its extension in physical property, to that extent does he lose his own rights. From this principle immediately derives the proportionality theory of punishment-best summed up in the old adage: ‘let the punishment fit the crime.’”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:12&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:12&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why must this value be held by libertarians? Simply because, if it were to be held that any violation of liberty could be punished equally, then the subtle gaslighting and indoctrination of a religious group, or the oppressive but non-violent ostracism of a community committed to a particular tradition, could be punished with the same severity, if deemed necessary, as a terrorist attack or a school shooting. Likewise, the failure to give enough to charity, or hire someone for a job, or competition with someone for a job and beating them to be hired, might be offenses punishable by law, because although they are not violent actions, without a theory of proportionality, we would not be able to choose which things are rightly punishable by law and which are not outside of whether we like them or not. Hence without a theory of proportionality, it is very easy to go down a very authoritarian and restrictive route that is inherently antithetical to libertarianism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;25-the-initiation-response-distinction&quot;&gt;2.5. The Initiation-Response Distinction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the final, and perhaps most recognizable, libertarian value, although I have couched it in new terms for philosophical clarity. The fundamental distinction here is best elaborated by the idea of the Non-Aggression Principle: the idea that violence can only be justified when used in retaliation, for the purposes of defense or restitution, and is justified by the very fact that violence was initiated, or used, prior. In essence, it points out the fundamental and seemingly self-evident, yet surprisingly oft-missed, moral distinction between the initiation of violence against someone who has done nothing violent, and responding with violence to someone else who has used violence against you. It is possible to be a pacifist and condemn both these things, but there are morally relevant distinctions between them, so that to condemn both, either you would need to broaden your reasoning from what is commonly used, or use different reasoning for the condemnation of each type. Libertarians specifically value these two things differently: the initiation of a violation of someone’s liberty is morally reprehensible, while retaliation against it is at the very least morally neutral, and sometimes even morally praiseworthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This view bleeds into many other libertarian views: views on when war is just (only in defense), when violence is just on a personal level (in self-defense or defense of others) and what the law can be used for (in response to actions, never prior to actions, further modified by considerations of proportionality).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some quotes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Men have the right to use physical force only in retaliation and only against those who initiate its use. The ethical principle involved is simple and clear-cut: it is the difference between murder and self-defense. A holdup man seeks to gain a value, wealth, by killing his victim; the victim does not grow richer by killing a holdup man. The principle is: no man may obtain any values from others by resorting to physical force.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:13&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:13&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“No one may threaten or commit violence (‘aggress’) against another man’s person or property. Violence may be employed only against the man who commits such violence; that is, only defensively against the aggressive violence of another. In short, no violence may be employed against a nonaggressor. Here is the fundamental rule from which can be deduced the entire corpus of libertarian theory.”[14]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This value is, in its essence, an extension of the principle of proportionality outlined above, in the sense that any action in retaliation to no action, or any violent action in retaliation to a non-violent one, is automatically and obviously unacceptable to a libertarian-minded person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-social-leftism&quot;&gt;3. Social Leftism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far what we have stated should not be controversial: we have attempted to identify the values common to libertarians, and as such these values are generally agreed-upon in the community. Now, however, we must proceed to the true purpose of this manifesto: an analysis of how a consistent application of these values to more than merely politics and law — as would make sense for anyone who actually held these values, as values cannot be held only in certain cases and not others — leads to non-traditional, and leftist, social views. Let us examine why this is the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;31-anti-traditionalism-and-moderate-pluralism&quot;&gt;3.1. Anti-Traditionalism and Moderate Pluralism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following on from individual self-determination, many of the reasons that support a distrust or dislike of state intervention also support a distrust or dislike of social norms and traditions. If the state should not intervene in economic matters because each person is in a generally superior position to know what is best for them and those around them in comparison to a central authority, and central authorities are unable to adapt to change, then it follows that “society” (as a centralized institution of majority enforcement and tradition) does not know what is best for everyone when it comes to lifestyle either. It would be strange to argue that although a centralized authority is not competent to know what the best job or allocation of resources is for everyone, it would be competent to know what the best family structure or lifestyle is for everyone. Likewise, if in economic decisions it is best for human flourishing to allow human beings to make their own choices, using their reason and values and integrity, then how can it be otherwise in the case of social decisions, which are arguably more important to a person’s happiness in many cases?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus we must say that tradition is to be viewed as a toolbox or selection of premade molds, which are to be chosen and evaluated by the reason of each individual in each individual case, and social enforcement of norms or normality is merely another form of illegitimate and stifling authority that is of very little use in most cases[15]. This must be extended to gender, sexuality, family structure, and every other corner of social life: every part of it must be subject to the reason of the individual, to be adapted to their unique situation and set of values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This implication is one even Rothbard himself seems to have grasped to some degree, although his social views did not fully encompass the implications here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Meyer begins with the complaint that libertarians are really ‘libertines’… because we ‘reject’ the ‘reality’ of five thousand years of Western civilization, and propose to substitute an abstract construction.  Very true; in other words, we, like Lord Acton, propose to weigh the growth of encrusted tradition and institutions in the light of man’s natural reason, and of course we find these often despotic institutions wanting.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:16&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:16&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must also recognize — in what I call “moderate pluralism” — that while some things are universally good for human life and flourishing (such as liberty), there is a wide range within the limits set by those constants within which the proper values of humans can fall, so that what is right for the flourishing of one person may not be right for the flourishing of another. Therefore, although it is possible to say that some lifestyles are wrong, it is not possible to say that one, or even several, lifestyles are solely right. This is an extension of the economic idea that there are many values that human beings could pursue (within certain limits), and that to attempt to discover which set of values is right for each individual in order to enforce it is a foolhardy task, but that if it were possible to do so, then freedom would be unnecessary and perhaps even undesirable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence libertarians must not simply tolerate those who pursue different lifestyles, while doggedly sticking to traditions, but must instead value in themselves pluralism and non-traditionalism, attempting to strike out and discover what is best for their individual case while praising and valuing the social entrepreneurship of others who try still other lifestyles. Thus it is impossible to truly be a conservative — one who thinks that following tradition is the best thing to do for all people, and does so themselves, and finds others who do things they don’t do disgusting or degenerate — while holding libertarian values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;32-anti-authoritarianism&quot;&gt;3.2. Anti-Authoritarianism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Libertarians are generally defined, on the two-dimensional political compass, at least, as in opposition to authoritarians by default; as such, it might seem redundant and even comical to list this as a value that is not often shared by right libertarians nowadays and must be specified. However, I think that, like the other values, the dislike for authoritarianism which libertarians express concerning the state is not often applied elsewhere, both in the social and the economic world. Many libertarians decry the authoritarianism and paternalism of the state, but see no problem with priests, pastors, and patriarchs telling people what to do down to the smallest minutiae, or with bosses and CEOs who are so far removed from the process of production as to be completely ignorant of it making choices for workers all day long, ensuring that those workers become little more than mindless machines or trained animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this juncture, many libertarians will recoil with horror at our lambasting of these social and economic phenomena, retorting that these things are not (usually) born of coercion and violence and therefore libertarianism may have nothing to say concerning them. That is not so! The idea that, simply because a value cannot be enforced by law, it is outside the scope of valuation in political philosophy is a fallacy born of the too-long-extended existence of an invasive state; there are many other ways of pursuing and enforcing a value than mere violence, ways that both libertarians and authoritarians have forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A true libertarian at heart, one which shares the values I have listed above, will not enjoy seeing the subjugation, even if voluntary and convenient, of one human being to another, the surrender of their will and reason to them, and the enforcement of this through any means whatsoever. Sometimes it is necessary or convenient, but it is never something one should seek or enjoy seeing. It is always, like some libertarians view the state to be, a necessary evil at best, and an unnecessary atrocity at worst. An overbearing father, pastor, priest, or patriarch can be as damaging to the flourishing of someone, and the operation and adaptation of the social community, as any government law, sometimes moreso; likewise, a surfeit of centralization in the economic world (whether through hierarchies of authority or through democratic means), or an overgrowth of corporatism and command-thinking, can be just as damaging to an economy as state intervention, although the latter is what usually leads to the former existing in damaging amounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, seeing all human beings as fundamentally morally equal, a libertarian must view any subordination or authority as a contingent and emergent phenomena, one which is not fundamental to the relation of one human being to another; thus the default, the null hypothesis if you will, is that there is no authority whatsoever, and any authority which wishes to establish itself must explain and justify its existence before a libertarian will bow to it. As Locke says, “there [is] nothing more evident, than that creatures of the same species and rank, promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature, and the use of the same faculties, should also be equal one amongst another without subordination or subjection…”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:17&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:17&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The process of seeking such a justification for the state, as I have said previously, is seen in the social contract tradition. As Noam Chomsky, a noted anarchist but not libertarian, has said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Hierarchic and authoritarian structures are not self-justifying. They have to have a justification. So if there is a relation of subordination and domination, maybe you can justify it, but there’s a strong burden of proof on anybody who tries to justify it. Quite commonly, the justification can’t be given. It’s a relationship that is maintained by obedience, by force, by tradition, by one or another form of sometimes physical, sometimes intellectual or moral coercion. If so, it ought to be dismantled. People ought to become liberated and discover that they are under a form of oppression which is illegitimate, and move to dismantle it.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:18&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:18&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;33-social-justice&quot;&gt;3.3. Social Justice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that libertarians value justice in the current distribution of holdings, and view it as an outcome and consequence of the justice of the individual actions that led to that distribution, lends itself naturally to a concern for historical injustice. While a conservative may say that some historical injustice is not relevant to the present, because it took place in the past and was performed by no person alive today, as they are more concerned with protecting the actual holdings and distributions of the status quo, libertarians who find that historical injustice has taken part in the production of the current situation, being committed to the protection of the moral right to property and not the positive right, must view this as immediately relevant to current events and what actions they should take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say, necessarily, that libertarians must be in favor of reparations. After all, although most libertarian theories of property rights are very similar, the specific details of how they are justified and worked out can have large effects on what should be done about holdings that have an illegitimate or unjust history. Furthermore, there are many morally relevant differences between different cases; Rothbard’s theory of property and criminality, for instance, in dealing only with present cases of theft, has six distinct cases in which the proper action is entirely different. (As far as I know, too, very few libertarian theories of property rights have very much at all to say about inheritance not based on explicit contract, which makes dealing with historical injustices more difficult). Importantly, in addition, libertarians are primarily concerned with individuals. Therefore, the collective punishment aspect of reparations, which is often done on the basis of racial groups, is immediately at least suspect and to most libertarians, off the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the historical process by which current holdings are arrived at, and current states assign their positive property rights, should be of interest to libertarians, and they should seriously consider the implications of the fact that much property, especially in land, was originally claimed by conquest and genocide. It cannot be so easily dismissed, as Mises did in Human Action, by simply pointing out that most property is not held in a direct line of inheritance now that a market system is in place, either&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:19&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:19&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; although this is a relevant factor, and perhaps indicates how a solution can be found and why those who own land now should not themselves be viewed as violent expropriators, it is not necessarily the last word on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-conclusion&quot;&gt;5. Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope to have shown, in this short manifesto, that to hold the values that provide a solid and consistent foundation for libertarianism consistently, social views that are fundamentally at odds with conservatism and reactionary thinking must be adopted as well. It is only possible to be a personally conservative libertarian to the extent that it is possible to tolerate cognitive dissonance, holding one set of values when force is involved, and one set of values when it is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commonly accepted fiction in the libertarian community of “thin libertarianism” is an impossible illusion. It is impossible because it puts forward the idea that as long as one holds certain beliefs, it does not matter what values undergird those beliefs, nor, if those beliefs are based on libertarian values, whether those libertarian values are held consistently. But those who do not share libertarian values can at best have a fleeting, insincere, and contingent libertarianism, and are murderous bedfellows indeed, and those who do not hold libertarian values consistently are open to cracks in their foundation of such a significant nature that it is a wonder that their beliefs do not crumble at a touch; moreover, those who profess to hold inconsistent values are prone to selecting one value set over another, and only pretending to maintain the other set, thereby often converting into the first type of insincere libertarian. Thin libertarianism was the dream of a strategy to radically grow a tiny and struggling movement, but it has ultimately failed, because it has led us to allow into our inner sanctums and philosophical cannon those who fundamentally do not care about the things we care about, do not value the things we value, and refuse to apply the values that they do share with us consistently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have welcomed fascists into our ranks because they were willing to support property rights, we have welcomed religious reactionaries into our ranks because they were willing to support property rights, we have sold our souls for property rights — only to find out that the people we allied ourselves with don’t value liberty, don’t value property, they merely want to be free from the government because the government doesn’t do what they like, and as soon as the government does do what they like, or as soon as they can achieve power by some other means, they will do all they can to destroy what we value. Worse, they have corrupted and weakened our philosophical foundations, furthering the fiction that any value set can arrive at consistent and hearty libertarianism. This is a falsehood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Libertarianism must reclaim its soul, by recognizing its values and applying them consistently, and in doing so it must transition from merely a statement about when violence can be used, to a statement about what we value, what is good, what is desirable. We must realize that simply not condoning coercion and violence is not enough, that we cannot sit back and claim the moral high ground merely because we are not murderers and theives, and cannot expect anyone to want to be around us simply because we have done the &lt;em&gt;bare minimum&lt;/em&gt;. There is more that a libertarian community must value and work towards. This will change what libertarianism is, fuse it with leftism and even a little socialism, but that is not something to lament or view as a necessary evil — those parts of these views which we synthesize into our position are merely the natural extension of what we already value, and so we should welcome a synthesis libertarianism with open arms, for it is a full embrace of what we already love so dearly.&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction There has been an invisible war for the heart and soul of the libertarian movement going on since the 1960s, and corruption is winning. The foundational values of libertarianism have been all but lost in the influx of alt-right and neo-reactionary people, and something must finally be done about it lest we lose those values completely. Thin libertarianism was the naive dream of a tiny and struggling movement striving to grow at all costs, but what does it matter if the movement grows, if the movement dies and becomes something else in the process? We need to take back “right” libertarianism. The purpose of this manifesto, then, is to establish a core set of foundational values which libertarians must share to have a consistent basis for their libertarianism, values that, we will show, are fundamentally incompatible with neo-reactionaries and the alt-right. Libertarian beliefs can be arrived at from other foundations, but a libertarianism thus conceived will be fundamentally at war with itself at best, and insincere at worst. This manifesto will focus not on specific conclusions, but instead on the values of the movement, because to do otherwise would turn this into an exercise in gatekeeping and thought-control, rendering our project merely an exercise in cult-building not unlike Objectivism or Austro-Libertarianism and thereby giving birth to nothing new and useful. It should be noted, however, that this focus on values and their consistent application has very broad implications — this is not a thin libertarianism 2.0. We will focus here primarily on the social aspects of this broadening, but values are applicable in a broad variety of cases, so setting out a list of them may have implications outside both politics and social interaction. If we are trying to rescue “right” libertarianism from its right-wing infiltrators, it might seem odd that we are, in the process, seeking to rename it. However, consider this: if the values that make “right” libertarianism unique are incompatible with the rest of the right-wing, is it truly valid to call it right wing? Moreover, since the values of “right” libertarianism actually most naturally lead it to embrace certain leftist social — and even economic — values, what better way to express that this libertarianism is a fusion of some economically right-wing ideas and some economically and socially left-wing ideas than to give it a name representative of such a synthesis? In the following document, we will briefly outline what these values are that libertarians as a movement must hold, and why they lead both to a respect for stricter property rights and social leftism and egalitarianism. 2. The Values of Libertarianism The most obvious “libertarian value” is, of course, liberty. This is made evident by the very etymology of the name of the movement. There are, however, many different conceptions of liberty: positive, negative, individual, collective, social, atomistic, and more; hence specifying the precise concept of liberty meant when the word is used is far more important than simply saying you value liberty. Almost every post-Enlightenment political philosophy, even the authoritarian ones, claims to bring liberty, by some definition or another, to the political organization and its members, and it is the precise definition that makes the difference between the different political philosophies. If Marxism, fascism, and libertarianism all claim to bring liberty, liberty means very little by itself. Furthermore, what specific definition you give to liberty, and the focus that one places on it relative to other values, depends on deeper, more foundational values. So, as simple as it might seem to claim that liberty, or even individual liberty, is the core value of the libertarian movement, I think it is necessary to delve deeper into its foundations. With this in mind, I will try to locate the deepest foundation of the libertarian value-set, and then build up from there, thus showing how the specific definition of liberty that libertarians use develops from that deeper foundation. 2.1. Individual Self-Determination The first value that libertarians must hold in order to have a secure foundation for other libertarian beliefs and values is that of individual self-determination: the necessity and desirability of individual human beings applying their own minds and situated knowledge to the particular conditions around them in order to solve problems and achieve goals. This value may be held both because it sustains and makes possible the flourishing of human beings, and because it is the best method of creating a dynamic, creative, and efficient society. A few quotes will serve to substantiate that this is a common libertarian belief: “Since men can think, feel, evaluate, and act only as individuals, it becomes vitally necessary for each man’s survival and prosperity that he be free to learn, choose, develop his faculties, and act upon his knowledge and values. This is the necessary path of human nature; to interfere with and cripple this process by using violence goes profoundly against what is necessary by man’s nature for his life and prosperity. Violent interference with a man’s learning and choices is therefore profoundly “antihuman”; it violates the natural law of man’s needs.”1 “Since knowledge, thinking, and rational action are properties of the individual, since the choice to exercise his rational faculty or not depends on the individual, man’s survival requires that those who think be free of the interference of those who don’t. Since men are neither omniscient nor infallible, they must be free to agree or disagree, to cooperate or to pursue their own independent course, each according to his own rational judgment. Freedom is the fundamental requirement of man’s mind.” 2 “He who lets the world, or his own portion of it, choose his plan of life for him, has no need of any other faculty than the ape-like one of imitation… he requires and exercises [uniquely human qualities] exactly in proportion as the part of his conduct which he determines according to his own judgment and feelings is a large one. It is possible that he might be guided in some good path, and kept out of harm’s way, without any of these [qualities]. But what will be his comparative worth as a human being? It really is of importance, not only what men do, but also what manner of men they are that do it. Among the works of man, which human life is rightly employed in perfecting and beautifying, the first in importance surely is man himself.”3 “If we can agree that the economic problem of society is mainly one of rapid adaptation to changes in the particular circumstances of time and place, it would seem to follow that the ultimate decisions must be left to the people who are familiar with these circumstances, who know directly of the relevant changes and of the resources immediately available to meet them. We cannot expect that this problem will be solved by first communicating all this knowledge to a central board which, after integrating all knowledge, issues its orders. We must solve it by some form of decentralization.”4 Why must this value be held? Because all human beings value the welfare of themselves and, to a lesser degree, other human beings; furthermore, all human beings care about the wealth and health of their society, as this influences their ability to achieve what they desire. Therefore, if one were to believe that freedom to exercise one’s choices was unhealthy for human beings, not conducive to their flourishing, and deleterious to the health of society, then it would be impossible to consistently and enthusiastically support freedom. Moreover, it is the freedom to make one’s own choices that is characteristic of the specific liberty which libertarians endorse, as opposed to the freedom from want or worry or oppression or isolation or even exploitation which other theories of freedom and liberty value more highly. Of course, many of those things can individual self-determination, but it is also possible that the use of one’s reasoning can make oneself worried, wanting, exploited, or isolated, and if this is the product of one’s free choice, then it is a part of liberty and its corollary, responsibility. 2.2. Consistency and Equality Another value of primary importance in the libertarian project, one which is necessary to provide a firm foundation for all the beliefs characteristic of those who partake in the movement, is that of consistency or universalizability. A libertarian desires not just individual self-determination (from here on, simply “liberty”) for some individuals, but for all individuals equally. A libertarian also requires the same duties and responsibilities from everyone: everyone has an equal responsibility for the consequences of their own actions, both to themselves and others, and an equal duty to refrain from coercing others, short-circuiting their process of individual self-determination by a threat of violence or by the physical prevention of their choice of action. Libertarians should have, and desire, no gods, kings, or masters, and only accept authority insofar as it is bound by the same rules as everyone else. All human beings share the same essential moral properties: the capacity to use our own reasoning and knowledge, and the capacity to understand, follow, and knowingly violate moral principles. Libertarians recognize this, and realize that whatever reasoning can be given for the liberty of some humans, can be given for the liberty of all humans. This is why the signature phrase of right libertarians, “taxation is theft,” exists — it is an application of the everyday moral standards and duties of the rest of humanity to the actions of the political class, and a judgement of what they do. This is also why social contract theory has been so important to the history of libertarianism, from Locke to Nozick: an account of how a state may be justified usually appeals to special powers, either granted by god or the collective, that allow some to act in ways that others may not; this is not satisfying to a libertarian, however, and so another account, an account that explains how the state could have arisen only from the common rights of man, must be found. Opinion concerning the success of such accounts is immaterial; the fact that such an account must be found if the state is to be justified in one’s mind is what is important to whether one is a libertarian. Here are a few quotes on this subject by various libertarians: “‘Equality,’ in a human context, is a political term: it means equality before the law, the equality of fundamental, inalienable rights which every man possesses by virtue of his birth as a human being, and which may not be infringed or abrogated by man-made institutions, such as titles of nobility or the division of men into castes established by law, with special privileges granted to some and denied to others.”5 “Equality of the general rules of law and conduct, however, is the only kind of equality conducive to liberty and the only equality which we can secure without destroying liberty. Not only has liberty nothing to do with any other sort of equality, but it is even bound to produce inequality in many respects.”6 “Anarchists hold that morality must be upheld in all cases, and not abandoned whenever State actions are involved. Men have long since rejected the Divine Right of Kings; surely it is now past time to do the same with all claims that the State is Extra-Human or Extra-Moral. The State must be judged on the same level and by the same principles as all other human actions and institutions; one rule applies to all.”7 “If every person has the right to defend even by force — his person, his liberty, and his property, then it follows that a group of men have the right to organize and support a common force to protect these rights constantly… Thus, since an individual cannot lawfully use force against the person, liberty, or property of another individual, then the common force — for the same reason — cannot lawfully be used to destroy the person, liberty, or property of individuals or groups.”8 Why, too, must this view be upheld if one is to be a consistent libertarian? This is perhaps a more complex answer, but it is nevertheless a very important one. The answer has three parts, the first of which I covered before the quotes, and I’ll cover the last two now. First, because a system which grants liberty to some and not others simply does not resemble what anyone would call a libertarian system; one of the defining features of libertarianism is the fact that it applies the same logic to every single individual within a society, since it is an individualistic philosophy. A system which grants liberty to one class, but allows that class to limit the liberty of another class, is an aristocratic or otherwise authoritarian system, not a libertarian one. Second, if the goal is to maximize liberty, then it must be recognized that we must give each and every person the maximum amount of liberty possible, and an exercise of too great a liberty of one person lessens the liberty of another (if I steal from you, I gain the liberty to decide the fate of the object I steal, but you lose that liberty; indeed, you lose the further liberty of deciding what to do with the outcomes of your prior choices that are concretized in that item). Assigning a fully maximal amount of liberty to a few and a proportionally lesser amount to everyone else is not as viable an option, because the maximum amount of liberty one person is able to experience is not as great as the medium amount of liberty of several, and allowing anyone and everyone to violate the liberty of others is not going to solve the problem either, as generally the violation of liberty either simply transfers liberties from one person to another (thereby not increasing the total amount), or decreases the amount of freedom exercised overall. Which of these three rationales, or what combination of them, you find most important and convincing will depend on what your foundations for holding these values are, but the important point is that you must hold these values. 2.3. Entitlement Theory of Justice In Holdings Another distinguishing value of libertarianism as synthesis libertarianism seeks to encapsulate it is a certain, as Nozick termed it, entitlement theory of justice in holdings. In this view, any rights one has over something are determined by the historical story of that object: how it was originally produced or appropriated and how it was transferred. There are of course differing opinions on what exactly constitutes just original appropriation, what exactly constitutes just transfer, and what should happen should the full history of an object not be available or be tainted — as most land is — with historical injustice. But the fundamental value that libertarians all share is the view that justice is constituted in the nature of individual actions and intentions, not in the nature of outcomes, so to establish justice in holdings, as in all other things, one must look to the actions and intentions which generated that holding — the history of that holding. This is, in a sense, an outcome of the corollary of liberty I mentioned some time ago, responsibility, since the fundamental idea is that one has a just claim to a holding if it is the outcome of just actions on your part, and one has no such claim if it is not. Here are some further quotes to substantiate this as a libertarian view: “[T]he right to property is a right to action, like all the others: it is not the right to an object, but to the action and the consequences of producing or earning that object. It is not a guarantee that a man will earn any property, but only a guarantee that he will own it if he earns it. It is the right to gain, to keep, to use and to dispose of material values.”9 “In contrast to end-result principles of justice, historical principles of justice hold that past circumstances or actions of people can create differential entitlements or differential deserts to things. An injustice can be worked by moving from one distribution to another structurally identical one, for the second, in profile the same, may violate people’s entitlements or deserts; it may not fit the actual history.”10 “Therefore, we do not yet know which one of the two men is the legitimate or just property owner. We can only find the answer through investigating the concrete data of the particular case, i.e., through ‘historical’ inquiry. Thus, we cannot simply say that the great axiomatic moral rule of the libertarian society is the protection of property rights, period. For the criminal has no natural right whatever to the retention of prop­erty that he has stolen; the aggressor has no right to claim any property that he has acquired by aggression.”11 Why must libertarians hold that private property, born out of the individual actions of people and determined in its justice by the justice of those originating actions, is a value that must be upheld? Again, first of all, it is simply a constituent property of what it means to be a libertarian in the sense that I have been using and in the sense that synthesis libertarianism is attempting to preserve; but secondly, it is because it is a necessary extension of the other principles so far. It is a construction of property which is based on the outcomes of individual actions within liberty, is equally applicable in its principles and rules to all people, and is necessary for people to preserve their own lives by their own hands and minds. 2.4. Proportionality Another component of libertarian value which is of primary importance is that of proportionality in justice. Although phrased barbarically, the old saying “an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth” really does sum up the libertarian approach to justice. A violation of someone’s liberty or property is to be met with a proportional, appropriate response, a violation in equal magnitude used either to prevent the violation from being consummated, or to produce restitution for a completed violation. This is what differentiates libertarians from other political philosophies in many ways: for instance, some progressives will advocate the use of the state — which operates on the basis of the threat of violence and kidnapping — to deal with violations of others that are not nearly so severe, even if they are undesirable: for instance, collusion to prevent someone from getting a job, or discrimination, or hate speech. These are undesirable things that actually violate the values I have previously outlined, but they are either the results of inaction on the part of the parties directly involved, or action that does not rise to the level of physical violence, and therefore to meet them with physical violence or the threat of it is a grossly disproportionate act. Furthemore, as part of making sense of this, it must be seen that the basis of whether something is a punishable crime is in the specific action that has been committed, and the extent to which it can be punished is in the specific action as well, as the punishment itself must be proportional to the action. Therefore, if no person or group was identifiably harmed, then harm cannot be done to a particular person or group in retaliation to that action in a proportional manner, because the action itself caused no harm to any particular person or group! This is why even those libertarians who view the state as legitimate tend to view it as a necessary evil, or an institution which should be limited to making laws against crimes which are proportional to the severity of the powers which it leverages to enforce its laws. This is also why libertarians, although they are interested in historical justice, are opposed to collective punishment based on ancestry or group membership. A few quotes will substantiate this point: [quote on how it is wrong to use the law to enforce against things that are not themselves violent] “I propose another fundamental rule regard­ing crime: the criminal, or invader, loses his own right to the extent that he has deprived another man of his. If a man deprives another man of some of his self-ownership or its extension in physical property, to that extent does he lose his own rights. From this principle immediately derives the proportionality theory of punishment-best summed up in the old adage: ‘let the punishment fit the crime.’”12 Why must this value be held by libertarians? Simply because, if it were to be held that any violation of liberty could be punished equally, then the subtle gaslighting and indoctrination of a religious group, or the oppressive but non-violent ostracism of a community committed to a particular tradition, could be punished with the same severity, if deemed necessary, as a terrorist attack or a school shooting. Likewise, the failure to give enough to charity, or hire someone for a job, or competition with someone for a job and beating them to be hired, might be offenses punishable by law, because although they are not violent actions, without a theory of proportionality, we would not be able to choose which things are rightly punishable by law and which are not outside of whether we like them or not. Hence without a theory of proportionality, it is very easy to go down a very authoritarian and restrictive route that is inherently antithetical to libertarianism. 2.5. The Initiation-Response Distinction This is the final, and perhaps most recognizable, libertarian value, although I have couched it in new terms for philosophical clarity. The fundamental distinction here is best elaborated by the idea of the Non-Aggression Principle: the idea that violence can only be justified when used in retaliation, for the purposes of defense or restitution, and is justified by the very fact that violence was initiated, or used, prior. In essence, it points out the fundamental and seemingly self-evident, yet surprisingly oft-missed, moral distinction between the initiation of violence against someone who has done nothing violent, and responding with violence to someone else who has used violence against you. It is possible to be a pacifist and condemn both these things, but there are morally relevant distinctions between them, so that to condemn both, either you would need to broaden your reasoning from what is commonly used, or use different reasoning for the condemnation of each type. Libertarians specifically value these two things differently: the initiation of a violation of someone’s liberty is morally reprehensible, while retaliation against it is at the very least morally neutral, and sometimes even morally praiseworthy. This view bleeds into many other libertarian views: views on when war is just (only in defense), when violence is just on a personal level (in self-defense or defense of others) and what the law can be used for (in response to actions, never prior to actions, further modified by considerations of proportionality). Here are some quotes: “Men have the right to use physical force only in retaliation and only against those who initiate its use. The ethical principle involved is simple and clear-cut: it is the difference between murder and self-defense. A holdup man seeks to gain a value, wealth, by killing his victim; the victim does not grow richer by killing a holdup man. The principle is: no man may obtain any values from others by resorting to physical force.”13 “No one may threaten or commit violence (‘aggress’) against another man’s person or property. Violence may be employed only against the man who commits such violence; that is, only defensively against the aggressive violence of another. In short, no violence may be employed against a nonaggressor. Here is the fundamental rule from which can be deduced the entire corpus of libertarian theory.”[14] This value is, in its essence, an extension of the principle of proportionality outlined above, in the sense that any action in retaliation to no action, or any violent action in retaliation to a non-violent one, is automatically and obviously unacceptable to a libertarian-minded person. 3. Social Leftism So far what we have stated should not be controversial: we have attempted to identify the values common to libertarians, and as such these values are generally agreed-upon in the community. Now, however, we must proceed to the true purpose of this manifesto: an analysis of how a consistent application of these values to more than merely politics and law — as would make sense for anyone who actually held these values, as values cannot be held only in certain cases and not others — leads to non-traditional, and leftist, social views. Let us examine why this is the case. 3.1. Anti-Traditionalism and Moderate Pluralism Following on from individual self-determination, many of the reasons that support a distrust or dislike of state intervention also support a distrust or dislike of social norms and traditions. If the state should not intervene in economic matters because each person is in a generally superior position to know what is best for them and those around them in comparison to a central authority, and central authorities are unable to adapt to change, then it follows that “society” (as a centralized institution of majority enforcement and tradition) does not know what is best for everyone when it comes to lifestyle either. It would be strange to argue that although a centralized authority is not competent to know what the best job or allocation of resources is for everyone, it would be competent to know what the best family structure or lifestyle is for everyone. Likewise, if in economic decisions it is best for human flourishing to allow human beings to make their own choices, using their reason and values and integrity, then how can it be otherwise in the case of social decisions, which are arguably more important to a person’s happiness in many cases? Thus we must say that tradition is to be viewed as a toolbox or selection of premade molds, which are to be chosen and evaluated by the reason of each individual in each individual case, and social enforcement of norms or normality is merely another form of illegitimate and stifling authority that is of very little use in most cases[15]. This must be extended to gender, sexuality, family structure, and every other corner of social life: every part of it must be subject to the reason of the individual, to be adapted to their unique situation and set of values. This implication is one even Rothbard himself seems to have grasped to some degree, although his social views did not fully encompass the implications here: “Meyer begins with the complaint that libertarians are really ‘libertines’… because we ‘reject’ the ‘reality’ of five thousand years of Western civilization, and propose to substitute an abstract construction. Very true; in other words, we, like Lord Acton, propose to weigh the growth of encrusted tradition and institutions in the light of man’s natural reason, and of course we find these often despotic institutions wanting.”14 We must also recognize — in what I call “moderate pluralism” — that while some things are universally good for human life and flourishing (such as liberty), there is a wide range within the limits set by those constants within which the proper values of humans can fall, so that what is right for the flourishing of one person may not be right for the flourishing of another. Therefore, although it is possible to say that some lifestyles are wrong, it is not possible to say that one, or even several, lifestyles are solely right. This is an extension of the economic idea that there are many values that human beings could pursue (within certain limits), and that to attempt to discover which set of values is right for each individual in order to enforce it is a foolhardy task, but that if it were possible to do so, then freedom would be unnecessary and perhaps even undesirable. Hence libertarians must not simply tolerate those who pursue different lifestyles, while doggedly sticking to traditions, but must instead value in themselves pluralism and non-traditionalism, attempting to strike out and discover what is best for their individual case while praising and valuing the social entrepreneurship of others who try still other lifestyles. Thus it is impossible to truly be a conservative — one who thinks that following tradition is the best thing to do for all people, and does so themselves, and finds others who do things they don’t do disgusting or degenerate — while holding libertarian values. 3.2. Anti-Authoritarianism Libertarians are generally defined, on the two-dimensional political compass, at least, as in opposition to authoritarians by default; as such, it might seem redundant and even comical to list this as a value that is not often shared by right libertarians nowadays and must be specified. However, I think that, like the other values, the dislike for authoritarianism which libertarians express concerning the state is not often applied elsewhere, both in the social and the economic world. Many libertarians decry the authoritarianism and paternalism of the state, but see no problem with priests, pastors, and patriarchs telling people what to do down to the smallest minutiae, or with bosses and CEOs who are so far removed from the process of production as to be completely ignorant of it making choices for workers all day long, ensuring that those workers become little more than mindless machines or trained animals. At this juncture, many libertarians will recoil with horror at our lambasting of these social and economic phenomena, retorting that these things are not (usually) born of coercion and violence and therefore libertarianism may have nothing to say concerning them. That is not so! The idea that, simply because a value cannot be enforced by law, it is outside the scope of valuation in political philosophy is a fallacy born of the too-long-extended existence of an invasive state; there are many other ways of pursuing and enforcing a value than mere violence, ways that both libertarians and authoritarians have forgotten. A true libertarian at heart, one which shares the values I have listed above, will not enjoy seeing the subjugation, even if voluntary and convenient, of one human being to another, the surrender of their will and reason to them, and the enforcement of this through any means whatsoever. Sometimes it is necessary or convenient, but it is never something one should seek or enjoy seeing. It is always, like some libertarians view the state to be, a necessary evil at best, and an unnecessary atrocity at worst. An overbearing father, pastor, priest, or patriarch can be as damaging to the flourishing of someone, and the operation and adaptation of the social community, as any government law, sometimes moreso; likewise, a surfeit of centralization in the economic world (whether through hierarchies of authority or through democratic means), or an overgrowth of corporatism and command-thinking, can be just as damaging to an economy as state intervention, although the latter is what usually leads to the former existing in damaging amounts. Furthermore, seeing all human beings as fundamentally morally equal, a libertarian must view any subordination or authority as a contingent and emergent phenomena, one which is not fundamental to the relation of one human being to another; thus the default, the null hypothesis if you will, is that there is no authority whatsoever, and any authority which wishes to establish itself must explain and justify its existence before a libertarian will bow to it. As Locke says, “there [is] nothing more evident, than that creatures of the same species and rank, promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature, and the use of the same faculties, should also be equal one amongst another without subordination or subjection…”15 The process of seeking such a justification for the state, as I have said previously, is seen in the social contract tradition. As Noam Chomsky, a noted anarchist but not libertarian, has said: “Hierarchic and authoritarian structures are not self-justifying. They have to have a justification. So if there is a relation of subordination and domination, maybe you can justify it, but there’s a strong burden of proof on anybody who tries to justify it. Quite commonly, the justification can’t be given. It’s a relationship that is maintained by obedience, by force, by tradition, by one or another form of sometimes physical, sometimes intellectual or moral coercion. If so, it ought to be dismantled. People ought to become liberated and discover that they are under a form of oppression which is illegitimate, and move to dismantle it.”16 3.3. Social Justice The fact that libertarians value justice in the current distribution of holdings, and view it as an outcome and consequence of the justice of the individual actions that led to that distribution, lends itself naturally to a concern for historical injustice. While a conservative may say that some historical injustice is not relevant to the present, because it took place in the past and was performed by no person alive today, as they are more concerned with protecting the actual holdings and distributions of the status quo, libertarians who find that historical injustice has taken part in the production of the current situation, being committed to the protection of the moral right to property and not the positive right, must view this as immediately relevant to current events and what actions they should take. This is not to say, necessarily, that libertarians must be in favor of reparations. After all, although most libertarian theories of property rights are very similar, the specific details of how they are justified and worked out can have large effects on what should be done about holdings that have an illegitimate or unjust history. Furthermore, there are many morally relevant differences between different cases; Rothbard’s theory of property and criminality, for instance, in dealing only with present cases of theft, has six distinct cases in which the proper action is entirely different. (As far as I know, too, very few libertarian theories of property rights have very much at all to say about inheritance not based on explicit contract, which makes dealing with historical injustices more difficult). Importantly, in addition, libertarians are primarily concerned with individuals. Therefore, the collective punishment aspect of reparations, which is often done on the basis of racial groups, is immediately at least suspect and to most libertarians, off the table. Nevertheless, the historical process by which current holdings are arrived at, and current states assign their positive property rights, should be of interest to libertarians, and they should seriously consider the implications of the fact that much property, especially in land, was originally claimed by conquest and genocide. It cannot be so easily dismissed, as Mises did in Human Action, by simply pointing out that most property is not held in a direct line of inheritance now that a market system is in place, either17; although this is a relevant factor, and perhaps indicates how a solution can be found and why those who own land now should not themselves be viewed as violent expropriators, it is not necessarily the last word on the issue. 5. Conclusion We hope to have shown, in this short manifesto, that to hold the values that provide a solid and consistent foundation for libertarianism consistently, social views that are fundamentally at odds with conservatism and reactionary thinking must be adopted as well. It is only possible to be a personally conservative libertarian to the extent that it is possible to tolerate cognitive dissonance, holding one set of values when force is involved, and one set of values when it is not. The commonly accepted fiction in the libertarian community of “thin libertarianism” is an impossible illusion. It is impossible because it puts forward the idea that as long as one holds certain beliefs, it does not matter what values undergird those beliefs, nor, if those beliefs are based on libertarian values, whether those libertarian values are held consistently. But those who do not share libertarian values can at best have a fleeting, insincere, and contingent libertarianism, and are murderous bedfellows indeed, and those who do not hold libertarian values consistently are open to cracks in their foundation of such a significant nature that it is a wonder that their beliefs do not crumble at a touch; moreover, those who profess to hold inconsistent values are prone to selecting one value set over another, and only pretending to maintain the other set, thereby often converting into the first type of insincere libertarian. Thin libertarianism was the dream of a strategy to radically grow a tiny and struggling movement, but it has ultimately failed, because it has led us to allow into our inner sanctums and philosophical cannon those who fundamentally do not care about the things we care about, do not value the things we value, and refuse to apply the values that they do share with us consistently. We have welcomed fascists into our ranks because they were willing to support property rights, we have welcomed religious reactionaries into our ranks because they were willing to support property rights, we have sold our souls for property rights — only to find out that the people we allied ourselves with don’t value liberty, don’t value property, they merely want to be free from the government because the government doesn’t do what they like, and as soon as the government does do what they like, or as soon as they can achieve power by some other means, they will do all they can to destroy what we value. Worse, they have corrupted and weakened our philosophical foundations, furthering the fiction that any value set can arrive at consistent and hearty libertarianism. This is a falsehood. Libertarianism must reclaim its soul, by recognizing its values and applying them consistently, and in doing so it must transition from merely a statement about when violence can be used, to a statement about what we value, what is good, what is desirable. We must realize that simply not condoning coercion and violence is not enough, that we cannot sit back and claim the moral high ground merely because we are not murderers and theives, and cannot expect anyone to want to be around us simply because we have done the bare minimum. There is more that a libertarian community must value and work towards. This will change what libertarianism is, fuse it with leftism and even a little socialism, but that is not something to lament or view as a necessary evil — those parts of these views which we synthesize into our position are merely the natural extension of what we already value, and so we should welcome a synthesis libertarianism with open arms, for it is a full embrace of what we already love so dearly.
