While conservatives are intolerant of other lifestyles, other races, LGBTQ+ people, immigrants, and so on, progressives are just as intolerant of bigots, racists, sexists, and authoritarians. They are equally intolerant, just of different things. There’s something crucially wrong with this statement, however, and in this post I want to briefly analyze what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, when conservatives point out that progressives, who are all about tolerance, are &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; intolerant of certain things, they are pointing at what Karl Popper called ‘the paradox of tolerance’. Basically, the core problem is that if we want a society where people are free to live their lives in peace, without the censure, constant criticism, and discrimination or bigotry of others, we must actually censure, criticize, and discriminate against those who do not want such a society. If we want to be free of Christians preaching that all those who live in ways that are different from the narrow, unhealthy, prudish norms that they adhere to will burn in a lake of eternal fire, we must be willing to raise our voices against them. In the eyes of conservatives, all they are doing when they are preaching against homosexuality or whatever the big scare of the day is, is criticizing things they don’t like, so when progressives criticize them for doing it, it looks like progressives are being hypocrites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core fallacy here is that of being over-specific: looking at only the specific actions that progressives take, and not why they take them and the context within which they occur. One way I like to explain this, and why the paradox of tolerance is not a paradox, is by comparison to something like the Non-Aggression Principle: only use violence against those who initiate it first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you only use violence against people who used violence on innocent people, then you are not the same as the person that uses violence against innocent people. In fact, you are explicitly set against that: if everyone would stop using violence against innocent people, you would stop using violence as well, so in a world where everyone follows the rule that you do, there will be no violence against innocents, meaning your rule HAS to be against such violence. The key difference is that on the one hand you have a person that will use violence for whatever reason, unqualified, and on the other hand, you have someone who will only use violence in response to the  first kind of person. Those are clearly two different kinds of people, and they are not on the same level whatsoever. This is basically what self-defense is, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applying this logic to tolerance and intolerance,  there is a crucial difference between people who will be intolerant of people who aren’t hurting anyone and haven’t done anything to them, and people who will only be intolerant of the first kind of person, only intolerant in response to unprovoked intolerance.  These are clearly two different kinds of people, because on the one hand you’ll have someone who will be intolerant of people for purely personal and arbitrary reasons, on the basis of what they merely find, gross or unusual or unfamiliar, and on the other hand you will have people that are intolerant for the purpose of protecting others and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, there is a difference between provoked intolerance, and simple bigoted intolerance. This is pretty clear from the fact that no one bats an eye when we are intolerant towards murderers, rapists, etc. Why? Because they hurt someone, they did something to deserve intolerance in response. That, to a lesser degree because it is usually nonviolent, is what intolerant people have done: they have done something to others that has justly provoked the resentment of the rest of society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is intolerant, technically, to not want to hang out with an asshole. But it’s not the kind of intolerance people are talking about when they’re talking about being “against intolerance.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alexis</name></author><summary type="html">One of the common refrains you will here from the conservative/anti-SJW/’politically incorrect’ sphere is that progressives are just as intolerant as they are, just of different things.

Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Up to now the victories of justice over injustice and of equality over inequality have been won by instinct and the simple force  of things, but the final triumph of our social nature will be due to our reason, or else we shall fall back into feudal chaos. — Pierre-Joseph Proudhon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two principles, which, when generally followed, bring the best average results in life for an individual who follows them, and also form the basis of a society which benefits all the members thereof. These principles are the principle of reciprocity, and the principle of autonomy. Stated concisely, they can be phrased thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Principle of Autonomy&lt;/strong&gt;: each individual must value for themselves as free a range of choice for their own lives, time and labor as possible, and must abhor domination, oppression, and authority.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Principle of Reciprocity&lt;/strong&gt;: each individual should cooperate with as many individuals as will likely cooperate with them, and respond to the interactions of others in kind: refusal to cooperate should be met with refusal, cooperation met with cooperation, and antagonism with antagonism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two principles, when generally followed, produce for the individual that follows them the optimal conditions to allow that individual to flourish, by fostering the best kinds of relationships between that individual and their community. When all other individuals in that community also follow these rules, these benefits are multiplied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moral force of this treatise, insofar as it can be called ‘moral’ at all, is therefore contained in a form of egoistic rule-consequentialism: it constitutes  advice, and general principles for action, which it would be wise for the self-interested individual to take heed of. No principle to be found herein is absolute; each is subject to the overriding force of holistic self-interested considerations, but neither should any principle be completely without force in the considerations of a rational individual. They should be followed by default, as a general course of action, because they produce positive outcomes far more often than they produce negative ones, and attempting to calculate the most beneficial action in each situation is too prone to error. Essentially, the prior probability in every situation is set strongly in favor of these principles, and so a lot of evidence would need to be gathered to be sure that going against them is a good idea, so only in situations where the benefits are clear and obvious should the principles be ignored. Thus the core of this treatise is an exhortation: if you want to promote your own autonomy and welfare, and moreover if you wish to cultivate a society with more of those things for all its members, then listen to what I say and consider it, because I think I present a good way to achieve those things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a positivist, amoral aspect to my analysis: because human beings are generally self-interested in tendency, if not in every specific action, and also because of how we have evolved as a social species to act reciprocally even when it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; strictly in our best interest in each case, there will be a strong tendency in a free society of people not possessed so strongly by other ideas (about authority and legitimacy, perhaps) to fall into line with my advice without needing to be told to do so. That way, not only can I describe how I believe an egoistic actor should generally want things to be, but I can also speak about how they will &lt;em&gt;tend&lt;/em&gt; to be in an anarchic state of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following sections, I will explain why these two principles are indeed as beneficial as I claim, and then I will elaborate on them in more detail, explaining the implications of consistently applying these principles to various areas of political, social, and economic life. Although I attempt to draw out these implications by clear logical deduction, because each principle and its corollaries are necessarily general rules not to be applied in every situation, my statements concerning their implications are &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; general rules, as are my statements concerning the &lt;em&gt;benefits&lt;/em&gt; of following any of these principles, corollaries, and implications. Therefore, consider all of my statements as statements of general fact, open to revision in the moment and in light of particular circumstances. Additionally, since this is an ethic for humans and for humans to interact with humans, I find it acceptable from time to time to use extraneous implicit axioms and intuitions, although I try to justify them wherever they crop up as particularly central to any argument. Please keep all of this in mind when reading further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;21-what-is-autonomy&quot;&gt;2.1. What Is Autonomy?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autonomy&lt;/strong&gt; is the freedom to choose what to do with one’s body, time, and labor. To think, speak, and act as one wills. We all, technically, have the &lt;em&gt;ability&lt;/em&gt; to do those things, even if there is a gun held to our heads, but to be free to do them means to have a range of choices about what to do with them that are all serious options — options that do not in themselves represent serious choices that will further narrow agency or destroy the capacity for it in a significant way, or cause significant harm to the individual. Thus, I am not in fact free to do what I want with my time, I do not have autonomy, if my choices are to do what you want or to starve because you withhold food from me, because my choices are limited to two, one which represents axiological (and actual) suicide, essentially, and the choice you present. Thus, I have autonomy to the degree that there are no serious obstacles to me choosing to do what I want with myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I do not use the words ‘freedom’ or ‘liberty’ to describe this value, and instead prefer to say autonomy, is that freedom and liberty are, particularly in a right-libertarian context but even outside of it, associated with a specific conception of ‘rights’ that is unhelpful to my analysis, and allowing such a connotation to creep it would only serve to muddy the waters for those familiar with most discourse around rights and freedoms. In this conception, one is free just in case one can do whatever one has a right to do, and any action that one is prevented from taking outside that sphere has, in this conception, no effect on one’s freedom, either to lessen it or increase it. Here is an example from Rothbard, from &lt;em&gt;For A New Liberty&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Freedom is a condition in which a person’s ownership rights in his own body and his legitimate material property are not invaded, are not aggressed against. A man who steals another man’s property is  invading  and  restricting  the  victim’s  freedom,  as  does  the man  who  beats  another  over  the  head.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:41&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:41&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, in this conception, the fact that I cannot take some food from you, even if I need it, is not a restriction on my freedom, because you have a &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; to that food. This conception of freedom is merely an imperfect representation of what is actually valuable about freedom, however, which is clear from the example that I gave in the first paragraph: if I am presented with two choices, one which represents axiological or actual suicide, and one which does not, then it should be clear that by any normal definition of freedom I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; free to simply reject the other option. I am &lt;em&gt;forced&lt;/em&gt;, the common usage of the term, to take the other option. This is why we say ‘I have to work’ or ‘my boss is forcing me to do’ this or that: yes, technically, we can stop working altogether, or disobey our boss, but if we do that, we likely face starvation and homelessness, at least ultimately, so we do not have any other real, live options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should be made even clearer by the fact that, in the standard rights-based conception of freedom, I am no more or less free whether I am a beggar on the street, owning nothing more than the clothes on my back and the labor I can produce, and a tech mogul living an opulent life across five mansions, capable of going anywhere or getting anything at the snap of my finger. Clearly, this is a strange conception of freedom. Moreover, it is a conception of freedom that does not see a hindrance to my ability to choose what to do with my own body and time, when I am prevented from walking my body over someone else’s land (trespassing), etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, all freedom is important: any restriction on my autonomy, whether through bad and limited choices or by physical force, even when used to protect ‘rightful’ things, is a noticeable restriction on me. If you prevent me from eating by preventing me from accessing food that I have produced, or that you have produced, as far as I am concerned the effect is identical: I starve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that all autonomy is equally worth protecting. The free ability to choose what to do with my body, time, labor, and the products thereof, in spheres which effect few or no one besides myself, is autonomy that is far more important, and far more closely felt, ordinarily, than the ability to go somewhere else and harass someone else. Nevertheless, sometimes it is not: sometimes not being able to do something that might effect someone else is an incredible, costly hindrance, a severe restriction on autonomy. It is important to recognize when some autonomy in the ability to interfere with the business and lives of others has been given up in return for greater security in one’s own life, because sometimes more is given up when the former is released than is gained from the latter. Likewise, it is important to recognize that all talk of rights, property, and freedom defined in terms of these things is an imperfect approximation of what we actually care about what it comes right down to it, because we care about &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; freedom, and sometimes the freedom we care most deeply about does not map onto property rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;22-why-is-autonomy-important&quot;&gt;2.2. Why Is Autonomy Important?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; we care about autonomy so much? Another reason that I prefer to use the word autonomy instead of ‘freedom’ or ‘liberty’ is that the word autonomy has an implication of self-directedness and self-determination to it that is important for a holistic understanding of what it is, which in turn is necessary to understand why it is so valuable. It will therefore begin to become even clearer why autonomy is so valuable if we explore the psychological definition of it, and the words surrounding it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quoting from the APA Dictionary of Psychology, autonomy is “in self-determination theory more specifically, the experience of acting from choice, rather than feeling pressured to act. This form of autonomy is considered a fundamental psychological need that predicts well-being.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:43&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:43&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Self-determination theory, in turn, is defined as “the concept that regulation of behavior varies along a continuum from  externally controlled (e.g., to obtain rewards or avoid punishments) to  autonomous or intrinsically motivated (e.g., to have fun or explore  interests). The theory emphasizes the importance of &lt;a href=&quot;https://dictionary.apa.org/intrinsic-motivation&quot;&gt;intrinsic motivation&lt;/a&gt; for producing healthy adjustment and asserts that negative outcomes  ensue when people feel that they are driven mainly by external forces  and extrinsic rewards.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:44&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:44&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In other words, autonomy is partially so valuable because it means the ability to choose to do things because they are intrinsically valuable or choice-worthy to the individual, instead of to avoid punishments or gain external rewards. Furthermore, I would argue that it is more of an problem to have to act to avoid a punishment than gain a reward — more psychologically damaging, more restricting of the ability to follow one’s own goals, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we have self-determination, so that choices flow from our own internal motivations and/or the goals in the external world that we seek, self-directedness becomes possible for us. Here is a definition of self-directedness, to bring this into focus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Self-directedness can be seen as the executive branch of a person’s  system of mental self-government. People who are self-directed recognize that their attitudes, behaviors, and problems reflect their own choices. They tend to accept responsibility for their attitudes and  behavior and they impress others as reliable and trustworthy persons. As a result, a person’s self-directedness is an important indicator of  reality testing, maturity, and vulnerability to mood disturbance.  Self-directedness is high in people who are mature and happy (Cloninger &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-28099-8_1163-1#CR2&quot;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;), whereas it is low in people with personality disorders and those  vulnerable to psychoses and mood disorders (Cloninger et al. &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-28099-8_1163-1#CR6&quot;&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;; Cloninger and Cloninger &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-28099-8_1163-1#CR3&quot;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:42&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:42&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is impossible, or much more difficult, to feel that one’s attitudes, behaviors, and problems reflect one’s own choices when those choices themselves were ones someone was forced to take. If someone was really pressured into taking a certain course of action, it is generally recognizable that they are &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; responsible for that choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the absence of autonomy, whatever actions that the individual takes, because they are made at the command, and therefore ultimately the decision, of another, for which the individual is not responsible, can have little joy for them, since it did not flow from them. Whatever they produce is not theirs, and their very time and life is not theirs to enjoy, is separated from them and made a kind of extension of another’s time and life in a kind of waking death. If life is good, subordination to another is evil for the very same reasons. Worse, when subordinated to another one is not free to build one’s own character as a human being, choose what to become. Instead, another person decides who you are, and you have little say in it, and so you become alienated from what you are. A slave who does whatever their owner commands because they need food is a person who becomes whoever their owner tells them to be, independent of anything actually stemming from them, and so becomes self-alienated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, living too long under the subordination of others will atrophy an individual’s capacity to make choices at all. What is unique to them slowly rots away from disuse, until they are dependent on their masters for everything. A person like this, even given their freedom, will not know what to do with it. We see this in those around us, and in ourselves, all the time: we do as teachers, priests, officials, or bosses tell us continuously, until the majority of our lives is consumed by being what other people want us to be, so that we become passive servants in our souls. Often, we do not remember how to learn something on our own, to produce on our own, to become our own person, to think on our own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autonomy also seems to be a core component of human flourishing, too: we have brains, can reason and make plans and choices for ourselves, and we are rewarded in mental health, satisfaction, and more for exercising that capacity, just as we are rewarded for exercising any capacity. Autonomy, self-determination, and the ability to self-actualize are key to psychological happiness&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:37&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:37&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:38&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:38&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. To become a full, well-rounded human being is not just some teleological end goal imposed upon us from the outside, but is also something that we can feel inside: there are rewards for becoming fully oneself, becoming fully human, exercising those capacities that make us so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a more fundamental reason that autonomy is crucially valuable, which allows me to treat it as a value that all human beings share — and provides the basis and framework for all others — without assuming that all human beings share the same values in other respects, as a moral realist would. This fundamental reason is that autonomy is the prerequisite for achieving all other values. If one is to pursue any value whatsoever, one must first have the freedom to do so: the freedom to use one’s own reasoning mind to choose what to do with one’s time and one’s body. If someone is subordinated to another they cannot be free to exercise their own mind and choice, and therefore cannot achieve any value of their own except at the sufferance of another, whose interests necessarily cannot be trusted to align with their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-reciprocity&quot;&gt;3. Reciprocity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“A man ought to be a friend to his friend and repay gift with gift. People should meet smiles with smiles and lies with treachery.” — &lt;em&gt;Edda&lt;/em&gt;, 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;31-positive-and-negative-reciprocity&quot;&gt;3.1. Positive and Negative Reciprocity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reciprocity, both in the community and in the individual, is what will safeguard  individual autonomy. Communities are composed of individuals, and therefore our first task is to explore how it is in the interest of the individual to engage in reciprocal respect of the interests and autonomy of others. Once that is established, we can speak about how a community of people who understand this common interest can operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one respects the autonomy of others, and interacts with them in a positive way, one is much more likely to be able to convince those others to respect one’s own autonomy, and to interact with oneself in mutually beneficial and positive ways. There are two reasons for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, because if you make it clear that you are treating other people positively in expectation of a return of that positive treatment, then they are incentivized to return it, in order to continue your positive treatment of them. If you do not return the positive cooperation I offer you, then reciprocity is broken, and I will cease to cooperate with you as well, ceasing to respect your autonomy and to give benefits to you when you do not respect mine and do likewise for me. Thus I motivate you to respond to my cooperation with like cooperation by the hopes on your part that I will cooperate with you, and you likewise motivate me to cooperate with you in the hopes that you will continue to cooperate with me. This is what is called a Nash equilibrium: because we both follow the same strategy, it is optimal for both of us to continue this strategy in most cases; otherwise, we loose benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, because human beings actually are &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; motivated by reciprocity than would be suggested by the purely rational calculus outlined above: we are motivated to cooperate with people who have cooperated with us even if it is a one time interaction&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and to go out of our way to cooperate with those who have cooperated with us, or punish those who did not, even when it is irrational to do so in a direct cost-benefit analysis&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. We are motivated to do this by feelings such as anger and resentment, but also friendship, trust, gratitude, and more. It would be foolish not to be aware of this aspect of human existence and actions in others. It would also be foolish to ignore these feelings in ourselves and try to stick to a rational decision theory only, as those feelings are their own negative or positive rewards, that, when not taken into account, take their own toll. Consider, also, that engaging in this form of positive reciprocity with others will actually encourage them to cooperate with you &lt;em&gt;even if they don’t like you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reciprocity is not always just about cooperation and goodwill, however. As mentioned when speaking about punishment and resentment above, in more extreme interactions, where someone not only ceases to cooperate positively, but actually does something negative, actors can respond with &lt;strong&gt;negative reciprocity&lt;/strong&gt;. If you actively violate my autonomy, and interact with me in a way that is unfair and deleterious to me, it is in my interest to repay that with like and proportional disregard and harm, so as to motivate you to cease doing that, and it is likewise in your interest to commit to the same strategy, to motivate me to avoid harming you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, in the case of negative reciprocity, one can only prove one’s commitment to this strategy of repaying harm with harm and unfairness with unfairness by action if someone else has already committed a harm or unfairness towards you, otherwise you would be the one ceasing cooperation first, so it is important to &lt;em&gt;verbally&lt;/em&gt; post one’s commitment to this strategy in order to make it known as a deterrant, whereas with positive reciprocity one can simply demonstrate with actions. Therefore, it is often beneficial to have explicit agreements or contracts with others concerning what will cause each of you to engage in negative reciprocity and to what degree, and to form mutual associations to multiply the force of such a commitment. Thus a “law” of sorts, built in game theoretic committment strategies and contracts, forms in the egalitarian world of mutual reciprocal interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proportionality is also crucially important when engaging in negative reciprocity: after all, if one engages in a grossly disproportionate act of retribution, others in the social mesh of mutual reciprocity that is the “community,” including and especially the ones you reacted against, are far more likely to view this as a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; violation of mutual respect for other’s autonomy, instead of a proper response. Meanwhile, if you stick to something in like kind and proportional, it will be clearer what it is a response to, and that it is not an overpayment. This is how one avoids blood feuds and the destruction of the social mesh that comes with such things. Importantly, the proportionality of the violation will have to be established mutually, through mediation with the one you are in conflict with, and socially if others are likely to act on behalf of the one you are retaliating against, or view you as a threat and cease positive reciprocation with you in return for perceived violations of proportionality (which it is in their interest to do, in order to incentivize everyone in the community to stay playing the reciprocal game even better).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, in a social situation where multiple people are all engaged in interactions with each other in a complex network, distributed cooperation or non-cooperation is possible. If one wants others to engage in sanctions against those who don’t cooperate with them and respect their autonomy, in order to multiply the power of their threats, or engage in cooperation with those who benefit them, to multiply the power of their bargaining, they need only promise to do likewise for the others (a contract which itself is enforced by positive and negative reciprocation), and it becomes possible for the the whole social network to become self-healing and self-reinforcing! Through the use of reciprocity, cooperation on the part of each of society’s members is rewarded, and harm punished, by not just the specific people involved, but by others as well (all, most, or just some). Thus if there are disparities in power between individuals, they can be evened out by the weaker individuals banding together to protect each other from the strong, and reward the strong even more generously for their cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ethic of reciprocity might begin to sound like the primitive ethics of “an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,” but there are crucial differences. Primarily, not hurting others (by being unfair to them, exploiting them, or by disrespecting their autonomy as individuals) is a form of positive cooperation with them, and therefore there is a positive clause to balance the negative one: “a gift for a gift and an eye for an eye.” Furthermore, this strategy, while primitive, is so lasting for a reason: it is actually, as I believe I have demonstrated, and has been extensively demonstrated in various scientific disciplines, one of the best strategies for actors that have to engage in repeated interactions with each other and/or can gain reputations.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:9&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:9&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:10&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:10&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;32-reciprocity-and-society&quot;&gt;3.2. Reciprocity and Society&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have demonstrated above that following the principles of reciprocity and autonomy is likely to be beneficial to each individual, whether or not those the interact also follow this ethic (but especially if they do). However, what benefits are there for promoting these principles generally, and encouraging an entire society to follow them? What, in other words, is the interest of the egoist in promoting others to follow this ethic besides the specific benefits contained in interacting with people who follow it? What are the benefits that are a result of the organic whole of society applying this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will sketch out the answer in brief. If society follows these as general principles, and treats a violation of positive reciprocity on the part one of its members as a violation to all of them, then one can expect to find a society in which it is most pleasing to live, as each interaction leaves both sides better off than before, and no one accepts subjugation of themselves, nor attempts to subjugate others. Every person gives a little of their autonomy, in choosing not to dominate others, in return for similar (and much greater because of the difference in number) consideration on the part of all others, while not really losing much, since autonomy as it is exercised in the domination of others is far less important than autonomy in one’s own labor and life choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a society, committed to the autonomy and mutual benefit of all, would be on average the best society to live in. Yes, there are a few who would be on the top of the hierarchy of a society which did not value these things, but the probability that any given person would be a member of that powerful elite is minuscule, and the conditions in such a society of the vast majority would be so far improved that the tiny probability of even greater advancement is outweighed by a rational calculus. That is not to mention the general benefit to all of more people being free and able to support themselves, in innovation and a healthier market and society at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to social anthropologists, reciprocity is actually a powerful basis for the success of our species and the formation of civilization, too. Quoting from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(social_psychology)#An_adaptive_mechanism&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; (because I don’t have access to the sources it is referencing, and because it’s quite clearly written):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Richard Leakey and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Lewin&quot;&gt;Roger Lewin&lt;/a&gt; attribute the very nature of humans to reciprocity. They claim humans  survived because our ancestors learned to share goods and services “in  an honored network of obligation”.&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(social_psychology)#cite_note-11&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; … &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_anthropology&quot;&gt;Cultural anthropologists&lt;/a&gt; support this idea in what they call the “web of indebtedness” where  reciprocity is viewed as an adaptive mechanism to enhance survival.&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(social_psychology)#cite_note-12&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; Within this approach, &lt;strong&gt;reciprocity creates an interdependent environment where labor is divided so that humans may be more efficient&lt;/strong&gt;… Each member can devote more time and attention to his or her allotted task and the whole group benefits. This meant that individuals could give away resources without actually  giving them away. Through the rule of reciprocity, sophisticated systems of aid and trade were possible bringing immense benefits to the  societies that utilized them.&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(social_psychology)#cite_note-:1-1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; Given the benefits of reciprocity at the societal level, it is not  surprising that the norm has persisted and dictates our present  cognition and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;33-why-reciprocity-consistently&quot;&gt;3.3. Why Reciprocity Consistently?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of relying on a distributed, decentralized network of reciprocal actions and game theoretic payoffs to protect one’s autonomy and interests, why not enforce it from the top down? Surely, if one desires to protect and ensure something absolutely, it is better to have a single entity that can impose it by force, for surely anything so loose and fluid as a reciprocal order cannot give as absolute guarantees!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not so. The introduction of unilateral force into any situation immediately gives everyone who you are using violence against an interest in rebelling against you. Worse, in instituting a system that is above you in order to safeguard your autonomy, you have placed your autonomy in its hands, and have it only at its sufferance. In your attempt to save your autonomy, you have in that very act destroyed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, creating an institution of centralized power introduces an ineradicable conflict between everyone around it. It becomes a race to capture power by those who have a vision of society that they wish to use that power to enforce — whether that power was intended for that end originally or not, power is fungible, and any institution powerful enough to protect your freedom is powerful enough to destroy it — and people who now have no choice but to struggle for power in order to, at the very least, prevent others from getting their hands on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more terribly, the introduction of unilateral force into a social network destroys all interest others might have in voluntarily helping you and cooperating with you: they will be subject to your violent invasions anyway, so they might as well acquiesce only at the point of your gun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, while the reciprocal order is a natural equilibrium point, an attempt to introduce a centralized means of control inherently and necessarily destabilizes any network of interactions, turning it into a race for control of the institution, and incentivizing all sides to use it for their own gain and to the detriment of others. The principles upon which such an institution stands, compromising autonomy for some for the purposes of others, subordinating all to its will and enforcing a singular outcome, requiring the fealty of those under it, are principles that undermine the possibility of freedom and mutual benefit. To introduce or support such a thing might benefit an individual in the short run, but ultimately endangers their own interests as well: if you create something that can unilaterally ignore the interests of others, you have no guarantee that it will always operate in your interests; and if you create a culture that sees it as acceptable to ignore the autonomy of some and subordinate them to you, you create a culture that accepts subordination, and sooner or later it will turn on you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another question that arises is why one should hold principles at all. Why not calculate out the benefits and costs of cooperation with others in each individual circumstance, and do as one pleases no matter what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to this is threefold. First, because being &lt;em&gt;known&lt;/em&gt; to have committed to a bargaining strategy, and taking steps to actually make it difficult to undo such a commitment, is an excellent way to actually get other people to cooperate with your strategy&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:38:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:38&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, as they feel they can trust you better. Compare this to someone who respects the autonomy and interests of others only when they feel like it, or only when the benefit to them is obvious and the ramifications of not doing so severe. No one will want to interact with such a person, as it is simply too dangerous. Therefore, self-interested considerations of the general, overall effects of one’s actions in a cumulative sense outweigh whatever one might think specifically and in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, because adhering to a principle unless in exceptional situations actually changes one’s habits and character, which is likely to make it far easier and more natural, and therefore even somewhat less costly, and certainly more safe and sure, to follow those principles. Committing to following certain principles, and building habits around them, is advantageous even if in some specific cases ignoring those principles is also advantageous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have hopefully demonstrated that the reciprocal ethic is an advantageous set of general principles to live by, and that a society founded on it will be far more stable and peaceful, and beneficial to each of its members instead of just a few, I can now freely continue elaborating it. In the next sections, I will be working out the implications, as I see them, of the two principles (autonomy and reciprocity) that compose this ethic. It should be noted that this is not an exercise in pure axiomatic deduction; instead, this is a working out of the implications of the reciprocal ethic by means of a combination of logic and intuition, as the task requires, since the point of this ethic is to foster understanding and cooperation between people, not purely philosophical robots, and so if something is a clear point of intuitive agreement, whether or not it can be fully justified from the ground up, it is acceptable. As long as the ethic clearly derives from a concern for individual autonomy and mutual reciprocity, it will serve to foster like concern in others, and eventually result in them following these principles as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;34-the-principles-of-reciprocity&quot;&gt;3.4. The Principles of Reciprocity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a fundamental difference between two kinds of positive reciprocity, and so far I have treated these two variations of reciprocity as equivalent for the sake of simplifying the foregoing conceptual analysis. I think it is time, however, to split them out, as I begin to formalize what the principles an individual following this ethic of reciprocity would follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two forms of positive reciprocity are &lt;em&gt;active&lt;/em&gt; positive reciprocity and &lt;em&gt;passive&lt;/em&gt; positive reciprocity. Passive positive reciprocity is cooperation with others to the extent of &lt;em&gt;avoiding&lt;/em&gt; taking certain actions towards them. This is best exemplified in positive reciprocity with respect to autonomy: to positively cooperate with someone in respecting their autonomy, all I need do is refrain from interfering with them. Conversely, active positive reciprocity is more stringent: I need to actually take a particular action that is different from the action I would have taken otherwise, in order to give a positive gain to the other person that they would not have received had I not taken that action. It is the act of giving a gift, as compared to the act of simply leaving someone alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passive positive reciprocity, because it usually requires so little from the person giving it, while increasing the liklihood of receiving something so important (safety from harm and theft, and one’s autonomy to act and pursue one’s own interests without being subordinated to or hindered unjustly by another) is a principle which holds effect in a far greater range of circumstances for a self interested actor than active positive reciprocity. After all, this ethic is only a set of heuristics and principles for a self-interested person to act by, not an absolute deontological set of rules handed down from on high, so if great enough needs arise, it can (and should) be cast to the wayside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why there is a greater expectation and focus, in my ethical and social writing, on passive positive reciprocity, in the respect for the autonomy and boundaries of others, than there is for active positive reciprocity, which is by far a more variable principle and depends almost exclusively on individual circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of this, the first and most important principle of the ethic of reciprocity is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-do-not-harm-others-if-they-have-not-harmed-you&quot;&gt;(1) &lt;strong&gt;DO NOT HARM OTHERS IF THEY HAVE NOT HARMED YOU.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the principle of passive positive reciprocity: cooperate with others, by &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; invading their boundaries and by respecting their autonomy, as long as they continue to do likewise and in the interests of encouraging them to do so. If they cease to cooperate with you, cease to cooperate with them: you are free to take positive action against them and their boundaries, to a proportionate degree. I will cover this in the next principle. If they begin cooperating again, return to cooperation with them, as that will ensure that they have an incentive to continue to cooperate with you, since if you will cease cooperating with them permamnently, they have no incentive to start cooperating again either, because you won’t respect them either way, and that way lies feud and gain for no one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always, then, the first principle is to maintain and continue and encourage &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt; passive reciprocal relations, whether that means opening with cooperation with new people, building up commitments and a reputation for such cooperation, or forgiving people (perhaps after some reparations to you) for ceasing to positively cooperate for awhile and returning to positively cooperating with them once that is done. The point is that when everyone engages in positively reciprocal, mutual relationships, everyone gains, and being willing to return to positive reciprocal relationships, after some punishment (either in negative reciprocation or just the cessation of positive reciprocation for a time), ensures that those who mess up or do bad things have an incentive to stop doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-if-someone-harms-you-harm-them-back-in-a-proportionate-manner&quot;&gt;(2) &lt;strong&gt;IF SOMEONE HARMS YOU, HARM THEM BACK IN A PROPORTIONATE MANNER.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is principle of negative reciprocity: if someone ceases cooperation with you, especially if they take action to disrespect your boundaries or your autonomy (negative action), you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; respond in like kind, in order to discourage them from doing so again, and therefore maintain positive reciprocal relations across the board. This means responding to negative actions towards you with negative actions (active negative reciprocity) and responding to a disregard of your autonomy, boundaries, or interests with like disregard (passive negative reciprocity).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be mindful, however, that the purpose is not simply to punish them for the sake of punishment, but to demonstrate a commitment to not being pushed around; furthermore, the purpose is not only or primarily to satisfy one’s own desires for revenge, but to do things rationally. Listening only to one’s desire for revenge is how you violate proporitionality in the eyes of the person you are in conflict with and the eyes of the community, breaking reciprocity yourself and making it worse for everyone. Thus it is better to act in a way that involves a punishment voluntarily agreed upon by the person who violated your autonomy and satisfactory, if relevant, to the rest of those with whom you wish to maintain positive relations, in the interests of placating everyone and returning to positive reciprocity while also disincentivizing violating it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it is in your interests to focus on making the ability to positively reciprocate whole again, which means ensuring that the person who hurt you is not themselves unilaterally or unsympathetically punished, and not resentful and unlikely to resume positive relations with you simply because you punished them. This means that negative reciprocation must be more voluntary than not on the part of all parties, even the one who initially broke reciprocity. This does not mean it must always be so, however, because in extreme enough cases the benefit of stopping or discouraging negative action far outweighs the dangers of permanently ending a chance for positively cooperative relations or proportionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-act-towards-others-as-you-would-have-them-act-towards-you-as-long-as-they-continue-to-do-likewise&quot;&gt;(3) &lt;strong&gt;ACT TOWARDS OTHERS AS YOU WOULD HAVE THEM ACT TOWARDS YOU, AS LONG AS THEY CONTINUE TO DO LIKEWISE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the principle of active positive reciprocity. This is actually in one’s own interest in fewer situations, and to a less significant degree. It should not dominate the wide middle swatch of payoffs the way the previous two rules should. However, when taken as the basis for mutual, peer-to-peer interaction and voluntary, fluid organization, it can be a very beneficial strategy indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultimate expression of this third principle of reciprocity is the gift economy and mutual aid, two principles of social organization not commonly associated with left-market anarchism, but perfectly compatible with it and actually endorsed by the principles outlined here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the gift economy, one grants needed items to others, with the hope and expectation that one one likewise needs something that other people have, they will grant it to you. Note that the concept of a gift economy relies on the concept of property being associated and rightfully aligned to a person, but simply being granted to others by its owners without a direct and upfront, proportional charge. Hence a gift economy is only possible within the context of a society that supports property as an extension of autonomy and reciprocally respects it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mutual aid&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:11&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:11&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is when participants, who view each other as equals, instead of charity-giver and charity-receiver, organize together in an attempt to help each other (and themselves by extension) and solve problems, by attempting to pool what they can give and take as little as possible (only what they need). Essentially, a voluntary organization along the lines of Marx’s classic saying “from each according to [their] ability, to each according to [their] need,” at a small enough scale that free rider problems can be avoided through social reprecussions, and within the context of individual autonomy instead of absolute individual subordination to the community or the collective. These can work to provide insurance, health care and health insurance&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:12&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:12&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and law enforcement&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:13&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:13&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and banking&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:14&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:14&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;41-property-as-a-guarantor-and-extension-of-autonomy&quot;&gt;4.1. Property As a Guarantor and Extension of Autonomy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although most forms of anarchism are hostile to property, I view it as a crucial guarantor of individual autonomy. Without the ability to own things, both to support one’s own life, such as food and shelter, and to allow for the ongoing support of one’s life, in the means of production, the individual is placed at the mercy of the collective. This can be formalized, as it is in some forms of anarcho-communism and in all forms of authoritarian communism, where the means of production are officially owned by the community, and so each individual is in the end subordinated to one community or another, unable to separate themselves from groups. This can also be informal: if anyone can take from you your means of survival and production at any time, for any reason, whenever they feel like it, you are just as at the mercy of everyone else as if it was formalized, just in a different way. You have no sphere to plan and act according to your own will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not just necessary to have the &lt;em&gt;ability&lt;/em&gt; to own property for use that is important to individual autonomy, however: it is the actual state of owning such property that is equally important. One’s actual autonomy expands and contracts in conjunction with the amount of property one is able to use. Someone who has the ability, technically, to own the means of production necessary to their own work is still not free if someone else owns the tools they use; their labor time is still subject to the commands of the capitalist, and the products of their labor still forfeit. Therefore, a too-strict adherence to private property in the Lockean sense still leads to the subordination of individual autonomy to the will of others, just as in communism or collectivism; the only difference is that instead of being subject to the community’s will, and thereby at least having some say (in anarcho-communism anyway), the worker has no say whatsoever but to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is crucial to note, in the course of this argument, that the function of property for the individual as a guarantor of individual autonomy hinges on &lt;em&gt;use and occupation&lt;/em&gt;. Property does not enhance the autonomy of an individual that never uses that property — in that sense it is completely neutral to them. Therefore, at least under this first understanding, there is no reason to respect someone’s property if they are not actually using or occupying it; if you cease to respect their absentee property, they will cease to respect yours, but no great amount of autonomy of your own will be lost in that, and much will be gained by no longer being subject to the commands from afar of capitalists and landlords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Property is also an extension of autonomy in another way, however. It represents &lt;em&gt;stored&lt;/em&gt; labor time. To take away someone’s property is to make it so that all the time they spent working to produce or buy that property was not actually spent for their own purposes, in service of their own plan for life, both then and in the future, but instead was spent laboring in service of your plans. Suddenly they were laboring under your command, for your purposes, in negation of their own will. The theft of property is therefore a violation of someone’s past autonomy. This is not as serious an offense as the violation of someone’s future or current autonomy, through direct coercion or the protection of property which allows you to hold dominion over them, but it is still a violation which has some serious impact, and is therefore a breach of reciprocation in an important sense. This must be considered even when seizing absentee property, although it may not weigh particularly heavily on the decision-making of an egoist adhering to my framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, property is both a guarantor of, and an extension of, individual autonomy. At the same time, property is &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; that, not a substitute for it. Elevating respect for and protection of private property to the top of one’s hierarchy of values is to serve an abstract ideal. This might seem like the right thing to do, but that is only because some of one’s own self-interest in generally protecting property has been invested into that ideal, and you are serving that component of your self-interest to the detriment of the others, and poorly as well. To do that is to make yourself a slave to something that is not representative of your full interests, and therefore is just as problematic as elevating god, altruism, the collective, the state, tradition, or a specific master over oneself. In light of this truth, the wise egoist must not make the same mistake that propertarians (right-libertarians and anarcho-capitalists) make by substituting true freedom for the freedom to dispose of property (externally or in one’s own person) how one pleases. There is more to freedom than that, even if that represents, and protects, some important components of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;42-absentee-property-eg-land-and-capital&quot;&gt;4.2. Absentee Property (e.g. Land and Capital)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this second conception of property, which is admittedly similar in many respects to the Lockean or Nozickean conception of property, it is important to clarify a key difference between the account of property in a reciprocal ethic, and the account of property in a side-constraints or natural rights ethic. In a side-constraints or natural rights ethic, property must be respected at all costs, and only in terms of its extension in labor, not the consequential extension the possession of property brings to people in having a free sphere for action. This is not the case in my ethic. If the possession of certain property is doing greater damage to the autonomy of an individual or group of individuals than violating positive passive reciprocity in this case would bring by making others (and the community as a whole) less likely to respect those individual’s own property, then it is in fact in their interest to cease respecting that person’s autonomy as expressed in that property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a tricky calculation: one the one hand, we have a great subordination and loss of autonomy because of the possession of some property by some person. On the other hand, we have an uncertain chance of another amount of autonomy being lost if the individuals harmed, or the community at large, stopped respecting autonomy in property to one degree or another, as a result of the individuals subordinated ceasing to respect the property being used against them. In most cases, the subordination to others that takes place because of property is not onerous enough to justify this: for instance, having to work in order to trade for what one needs in life is a small price to pay for security in the product of one’s labor and a sphere in which one is safe to act as one pleases. I could certainly try to live for free off the produce of others, but soon they would cease to respect my autonomy, or my ability to possess things, and I would quickly lose &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;. Furthermore, in most cases, disrespecting other’s property disrespects their direct autonomy as represented in the first aspect in which property means autonomy, as well as indirectly in because of the labor time stolen. Both of these together are a very powerful investment of autonomy into something, and so to stop respecting property in which both of these things are invested is a very great violation of passive positive reciprocity and would be greeted as such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of &lt;em&gt;absentee&lt;/em&gt; property, conversely, the story is different. Absentee property, through extortion, rent, or profit, can exact huge losses of autonomy on people, as the loss of something intimately necessary to their ability to labor, live, etc. is threatened in order to get them to subordinate themselves to another’s authority docilely. On the other hand, the loss of absentee property causes no loss of autonomy in the first sense in which property is invested with it on the part of the absentee owner, as they were never using that property to begin with, nor was it something they were relying on to maintain their autonomy or free sphere of action. There is a loss of autonomy as represented in the past labor time invested into the property by the absentee owner, but with the benefit in alleviating subjugation, the direct gain in gaining new property to labor on and govern oneself with, and without the added direct loss of autonomy in the first respect, as well as the fact that others besides the owner of the property may not choose to even involve themselves in negative reciprocation, it should be clear that in most cases respect in absentee property should be hard to come by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not that absentee property should not be totally disrespected in all cases; controlling the product of one’s labor is very important to an individual’s autonomy, and thus the respect of someone’s labor time as it is invested in objects is too. A society that constantly, lightheartedly, and frivolously violated property rights, even in absentee property, undercuts half of the reason anyone respects anyone else’s property at all, and endangers itself. Thus, property that is owned by a person who does not regularly use it, but which is neither needed by others, nor regularly used by others who are dominated by its owner, can and should be respected as a general principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;43-abandonment&quot;&gt;4.3. Abandonment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another exception to the rule of respecting private property on the basis of the invested labor time of the original owner is in the case when the thief, having held the property for some amount of time, has actually invested more labor into it than the original owner did, in either repairs, upkeep, or improvements. In such a case, to return the property to the original owner would be a greater disrespect of the autonomy of the thief than the thief’s original theft was of the owner’s autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is not a hard-and-fast rule, as proportionality is more in the eyes of the beholders than it is an objective rational science, but it would still produce a tendency for property to stay with the person who has worked on it more. Additionally, such cases are usually only going to arise in the case of property that was either clearly abandoned, or absentee to begin with, with the original owner swooping in at some later date in order to reclaim something they never cared about before. That means that people are even less likely to care about respecting their original claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;44-the-defense-of-property&quot;&gt;4.4. The Defense of Property&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must note here that one is not simply justified in using any means necessary to protect one’s property, but instead must use methods to protect it that are proportional to what the violator did. For example, if someone enters my house, I cannot begin by shooting them. I must ask them to leave, try to guide them out by the arm, and only when they start resisting my attempts by attacking me, may I engage with them in self-defense while also trying to move them out of my house. However, preventing someone from entering my house in the first place is not an attack on their autonomy, as they had no right to be there in the first place, nor is preventing someone from entering some space, as I have just as much right to stand in a certain spot (even if it happens to be at the entrance of some place they desire to go) as they do, and if they attack me to move me out of the way, that is &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; fault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, all the direct and known-beforehand consequences of actions taken in the name of negative reciprocity count as part of their consequences, and therefore must be counted when it comes to whether they are proportional or not.  Thus, kicking someone off of my property and hence directly off the edge of a cliff, forever, does not merely count (as naive right-libertarians imagine) as kicking them off my property, but also counts as killing them when they reach the bottom of that cliff. This does not include consequences of actions taken in defense of my autonomy that are merely the continuation of something that would have happened otherwise, where the violation of my autonomy which I am undoing is merely a suspension of what would have happened had that violation of my autonomy not occurred at all. For instance, if someone is dying, and they hook themselves up to me in order to use my body to survive, when I unhook them, I am defending my autonomy, but as a direct result of my action they are now dying again. This, however, is not my fault, since they were already dying before they interacted with me or I with them, and my action was merely removing an unjustly acquired suspension of an already-occurring process from their grasp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;51-contracts&quot;&gt;5.1. Contracts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a myriad of forms which the hierarchies of authority which sap individual autonomy may take. One is force, another is dependence  (typically through claims on absentee property), and a third, less often discussed, is &lt;em&gt;contract&lt;/em&gt;. Under the traditional conceptions of contracts seen throughout society and often preserved in right-libertarian writing, a contract is essentially a promise that is legally, or ethically, enforceable. Therefore, whatever each side of the contract promises to do or provide can be compelled from them if the other side of the contract performs their end of the bargain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has clearly authoritarian and oppressive implications. On a conceptual level, each person is in some sense the same individual as they were when they originally made a contract, but in some sense crucially relevant to autonomy, they are not. They are a different, similar person, and to be indefinitely and implacably bound to the promises and statements they have made in the past is its own special kind of odious bondage. If I promise to do something, but later realize that it was a poorly thought out idea and no longer want to participate in whatever I promised to do, it is fundamentally an extreme abridgment of my ability to rationally plan my own course in life and choose my actions, as well as my ability to control how my time (and labor) is spent, and with whom, to compel me by force to adhere to my promise. After all, when I, in passive positive cooperation, respect the autonomy of others, no positive action is required of me, and no encroachment is made into the sphere within which my autonomy exists. My absolute freedom is abridged, perhaps, but only slightly, and in return, a much more relevant freedom is ensured. And there is nothing on the other side of this equation: if I refuse to adhere to a contract, &lt;em&gt;no one’s autonomy is abridged!&lt;/em&gt; People are disappointed, certainly, and they may choose not to interact or trade with me in the future because they do not view me as trustworthy, but I &lt;em&gt;have not broken passive positive reciprocation whatsoever&lt;/em&gt;. Therefore, the only motivation one has to keep contracts is the social motivation of wanting to be viewed as trustworthy and wanting to engage in positive active reciprocation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will still be a need for the actual paper and language of contracts to some degree in a world of reciprocal ethics, however. After all, in the social realm, it is still useful to have a record of the promises one has made and the conditions under which everyone agreed to consider them fulfilled, in order to have some way of settling disputes concerning allegedly broken promises and betrayed trust, so that those involved do not get their reputations destroyed unfairly or unnecessarily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about when there is mutual consideration involved in contracts, however? In that case, if one side does not uphold their side of the contract, but receives and takes the property of the other, the conditions under which the other side agreed to consider that property a product of the invested labor time of the other party do not hold, and so that other party is currently holding stolen property, which is a violation of the autonomy of the other party, and the property should be returned. Likewise, if the cheated party did labor for the other party, again their autonomy was abridged, as they were forced to use their bodies and time in a way that they would not have if they had known the truth of the outcome; however, labor is an immaterial, ethereal thing which disperses into objects and representations, and therefore, a direct return of that labor may be impossible. If it was invested into a particular object which was then to be transferred to the cheating party, that object becomes the property of the person who labored on it, as one example of how that limitation might be evaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In repossessing stolen property, it is important to remember that if damage is down to the thief in excess of the damage done by the theft, and the subsequent defense of that theft if applicable, it should probably be repaid in some way. This is likely to be ensured if both sides are interested, as they should be, in re-establishing positive and cooperative relations, and if both sides have mutual defense or insurance associations representing their interests, as they probably would, both side’s interests are likely to be represented, although in clear-cut cases, it will be fairly easy to discern who violated reciprocity — which all parties view it as in their interest to preserve — and so those representing that side will be less likely to defend them because they don’t want it to be common for those who violate reciprocity to get away with it easily, as that is not beneficial to them either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of all this, a new picture of contracts emerges under this ethic: one where contracts can be voided at any time, for only the return of any transferred property or labor to their original owners if possible. This respects the choices and autonomy of all involved in my view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;52-sale&quot;&gt;5.2. Sale&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the incompatibility of being forcefully held to one’s promises and individual autonomy itself, what about sale? It would seem, since sale is simply the promise of an item to another person, that the seller could simply repossess their sold property at any time. This is actually incorrect, however: when someone transfers some property to another, they are not giving up the freedom or autonomy of their future selves at all. On the contrary, they are merely stating in that moment that the labor time that they invested in that object was done ultimately for the gain of that other person, and thereby disavowing a connection with that labor time. Once the connection is broken, it is no longer considered a part of their sphere of free action, their autonomy. Instead, the labor time the buyer invested in whatever they traded for the property is now invested in that property, as they &lt;em&gt;had to invest that labor time&lt;/em&gt; in order to receive that property and so, by analogy, that labor time is invested &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; the property. Furthermore, it becomes part of their sphere of autonomous action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;53-coercion-and-consent&quot;&gt;5.3. Coercion and Consent&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One crucial component of any contract, or any other interaction for that matter, is consent. Without consent, one party is merely subjugating and dominating the other party, abridging their autonomy and breaking the positive reciprocation of cooperation. Acting on someone without their consent is in fact the &lt;em&gt;primary&lt;/em&gt; example of disrespecting someone else’s autonomy, because when you do so, you are choosing for them — either directly, through non-consensual physical invasion — or indirectly — through extortion or other means — what happens to their body, time, and life, without consulting them as to whether it is part of their free plan for life, a choice of their own that is a product of their thinking mind. Furthermore, if someone does not clearly know the consequences of agreeing to some interaction, and the commitments that would entail, engaging in that interaction is just as clearly a violation of their autonomy as engaging in an interaction they actively reject. After all, if they do not know the consequences of what they are agreeing to, how can they actually have chosen what will result from that interaction?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What constitutes consent and coercion, exactly, though? Technically speaking, it could be said that any action is ‘consensual’ if the other party is not specifically imposing consequences that, but for their choice to do so, would not be present, and which constitute direct invasions of someone’s body or property completely absent any choice on their part. This is the definition of consent/coercion that is most directly hinted at by the analysis above. This is the simplistic definition of consent: if there is no one holding a gun to your head, or someone else’s head, or threatening to steal something, etc., then the action is consensual and does not constitute an abridgment of autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As should be clear from how I have been using the concept of disrespecting (or abridging) autonomy up until now, however, consent is not an obviously binary thing. The simplistic picture is an incomplete analysis. An interaction which is technically ‘voluntary,’ in that it does not constitute a direct violation of person or property, or threat thereof, can still remove much autonomy, much ability to choose what to do with oneself and one’s time, labor, etc., without being strictly coercive in the simplistic sense. This can happen when someone is faced with options that in themselves represent enough of a loss of autonomy that it seems that to preserve what autonomy they have, they must choose from a far more restricted set of options. Once the stage is set like this, the person is left open to those who control the restricted set of options to use their advantage to control the choices, time, and labor of those with restricted options to almost as great a degree as the other options themselves. Thus, if my choices are starvation, suicide, and working for someone, they can, if they so choose, push the loss of autonomy of working for them all the way up to the point where it is just barely better than starvation or death. If they do so, it is unclear how this choice to work for them, and the life under them, can be termed free, consensual, or voluntary without being nearly farcical. There is no autonomy to be found in the other two choices, and nearly none in the final choice taken; as such, squeezing the autonomy out of the only choice that has some of it at all should clearly be recognized as an abridgment  of autonomy. Not as great as the simplistic version of coercion, perhaps, and depending on the amount of autonomy left in the unpleasant options and the amount squeezed out of the main option, the greatness of the coercion can vary, but nevertheless, using a superior position to do such things represents a violation of positive cooperation in respect for autonomy to some degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conjunction with my arguments in section for with regard to absentee property, this understanding of consent as representing the amount of autonomy left in all the options one has open to one, and violations of consent being perpetrated by those who control the amount of autonomy represented in certain options, present a powerful argument against collectivism, but also capitalism, workplace harassment, and more. This is also what justifies the definition of consent as needing to be ongoing and enthusiastic: if consent is actually positively withdrawn, then to continue is a violation of autonomy no matter what; if consent is not enthusiastic, then there is probably a limiting of autonomy going on, which in turn is probably a violation of the reciprocal order, which might need more or less of a response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How should this response be carried out? Because consent is more of a gradient than a binary switch, and the degree to which consent is given — and therefore the severity of the reciprocal response required, if any, from either the person involved or the community as a means of protecting each other — any response is going to be inescapably subjective. It is not possible to require (or enforce) a single, legitimate, ‘correct’ decision regarding of coercion has taken place or not. As such, each person will have to react to an interaction that may or may not be consensual by their own lights, defending the person being taken advantage of, or not, to some degree or another, as they best see fit. Each person’s actions and commitment to their opinions concerning the matter will be judged against the others by the action of market forces and the interactions of the reciprocal order, with people who react truly out of line themselves violating the reciprocal order and being brought back down to earth. Thus, a system of ‘enforcement’ of consent will develop through a stigmergic process, instead of enforcing a single consent standard that might, on the one hand, be too lenient, or on the other hand, bar someone from making a bargain that, while an abridgment of their autonomy, is simply the best option available. Without a centralized system enforcing a single ‘legitimate’ rule concerning what counts as consent or not exceptions can be made for particular situations as needed by those best in a situation to know what is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To establish a base level of ability to consent, maturing people could perhaps be presented with a rite of passage, or a psychological evaluation that results in a score or set of scores, on the basis of which each member of the community could judge whether the person is generally — when in their right mind, etc — able to consent to interactions, and react to that person and those who interact with &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; accordingly. It would be important that there be no specific ‘pass’ or ‘fail’ state to such a test, but instead a score that accurately represents some capacity, so that the decision is made available for all to judge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;54-just-price&quot;&gt;5.4. Just Price&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also perhaps the seeds of a ‘just theory of price’ here: if the price, represented in property, demanded by a seller far exceeds (in invested labor time) the amount of labor time actually invested in the object, then it could be the case that this person is not respecting the autonomy of the other person, as represented by their labor time, as much as their own. This is not a total violation of positive reciprocal cooperation, but it is something important to consider, and may or may not constitute something that requires correction. This is especially true in the case when the amount of labor time (and invested autonomy) required for the use of property is designed to be indefinite and limitless, such as in the case of rent, profit, or interest: in those cases, we have someone demanding near limitless concessions of autonomy in return for a small concession of autonomy on their part. In this specific case, the limit of any number over a number tending towards infinity is zero, and so it could be said that the landlord, capitalist, or banker, in asking for these infinite rents, has no respect for the autonomy of others. Therefore, in this particular case of unequal price, it is not only an unequal respect for autonomy, which might be dealt with but might not (depending on the circumstances), but a complete violation of reciprocity, which should probably be met with some response. Note that this only applies to people charging a continuous price for a singular item which they invested a finite amount of labor time into in the past; if it is an ongoing service, then it is fair to ask an ongoing price for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is crucially different than the Marxist labor theory of value because it does not specify absolutely that any unequal price, when calculated in labor time, is exploitation on the part of one person or another, nor that every exchange must take place between things that the same amounts of labor have gone into. I do not reject the marginalist viewpoint on the origins and nature of value and price on the market. Instead, this is merely to set boundaries on price. As long as prices are roughly sensible, no one will have an issue, even if they are fairly unequal in invested labor time. As long as the amount of effort and skill invested in something is recognized in the trade, it will be seen as acceptable cooperation; but if the amount given on one side is vastly out of proportion to the amount given on the other side, then cooperation will begin to break down dangerously.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:40&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:40&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a society of individuals committed to autonomy and an ethic of reciprocity, it is impossible to dictate, plan, or predict what the specific modes of organization and solutions to problems would be. To expect an individualist anarchist to give a precise account of what life post-state and post-capitalism &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; look like is like asking someone to predict the next invention on the market, or the next philosophy that would be produced, or any number of the other things that are the product of the creativity of individuals, acting alone or in concert. It is simply an impossible task, and a task that no one should &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to do: freeing up individuals to use their own reason and their own ideas in their organization with others and attempts to figure out how to live with others is the entire point of anarchy, and the fact that so many more creative and individual minds will be set to the task, and so many more new solutions tried, is one of the many benefits. Therefore, not only can I not offer a picture of what an individualist anarchist ‘society’ would look like, I refuse to! However, I can offer some ideas about what I think will be most likely, and some ways things &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; work. Keep in mind, all the more, however, that these are merely ideas, not plans or prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individuals committed to the ethic laid out herein would probably organize, insofar as they organize at all, in very different ways than individuals in our modern socioeconomic context do. First of all, in order to preserve their autonomy within the sphere of production, there would be a great preference for independent contracting: each individual produces what they think best to produce on their own, under no authority, with the means of production that they personally own and use, under the guidance of no one but themselves.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:36&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:36&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This ideal is increasingly possible, as the means to manufacture everything (both physical and non-physical) become smaller and cheaper; we can see the seeds of this in the DIY and ‘maker’ communities, as well as in the world of software development. It will only become more possible without a patent monopoly limiting competition dramatically (especially in preventing individuals from producing patented goods) and enforcing cartelization.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:19&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:19&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These independent contractors would trade with each other for parts or whatever else they need to produce a finished project at their stage of production, and perhaps create contract agreements to buy certain amounts at certain prices with each other, but such contracts are of course not enforceable and so the network of independent producers would be fundamentally fluid, responding rapidly to the demands of the market and the abilities of individuals, as a peer-to-peer, decentralized economy. This would be further facilitated by just-in-time manufacturing techniques, and prevented from being overridden by competition from large centralized corporations (or cooperatives) by the fact that transportation and centralization would no longer be subsidized by a State. These fluid ‘mesh networks’ of producers would also be far more efficient and responsive to market conditions, and lacking all of the knowledge and calculation problems inherent in centralized, non-market modes of production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insofar as it is impossible to break some process of production down into sections that can be performed by individuals in a reasonable manner that is not overcome by transaction costs, individuals will need to form organizations to produce certain things. It is my opinion that worker cooperatives of one type or another will be preferred for this task. Worker cooperatives are a superior organizational form to corporations for many reasons. It is easier for them to hire workers because they present a far better offer: one in which the profits of working for the cooperative are directly placed in the hands of the workers, instead of the workers having to depend on the caprices, poor knowledge, and adverse incentives of bosses in order to get a reward; in which the each worker is subject to far less arbitrary authority and hierarchy, and indeed retains some control over their workplace, through being a partial owner of the whole business; and one in which, because of that partial ownership, each worker enjoys far greater job security and stability, as well as the hope of decreased hours across the board and stabilized pay in the face of automation, instead of (sometimes) increased pay for some and unemployment for others. Worker cooperatives are also likely to be more efficient, as they do not suffer as severely from worker incentive problems, principal-agent problems, knowledge problems,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:15&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:15&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and calculation problems.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:16&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:16&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the worker cooperative remains a form of authority and hierarchy, just a less severe and despotic one than corporations and bossism: after all, one is subordinated to the collective vote of the other workers. One has some say in it, at least, and at least everyone who is in control is at the same level of the organization as those who are controlled and are therefore subject to whatever rules they make for themselves, but nevertheless democracy is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; perfect individual freedom, whatever the communists will tell you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not deny that corporations may exist, either, but I suspect they will be greatly reduced in power when worker cooperatives are free to compete with them; right now, under the current state capitalist system, there are very many subsidies, monopolies, and privileges that corporations and the wealthy have received, and continue to receive, from the system which do not stem from free market forces&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:15:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:15&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:17&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:17&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:18&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:18&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:19:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:19&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:20&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:20&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:21&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:21&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:22&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:22&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:23&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:23&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I also think that the economy will be much more focused on local business, whether individual, cooperative, or corporate, as the efficiencies of locality and just in time manufacturing overcome the outweigh the efficiencies of scale and mass-production when the need for transportation, no longer subsidized by the state — and by extension local communities — comes into play.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:17:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:17&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, under a free market, labor unions would be far more free to equalize the bargaining power between corporations and their workers, capable of taking direct action and using all of the tactics of asymmetric warfare that have been either outright outlawed today or have fallen out of favor for cultural reasons due to the state’s co-opting of the labor movement.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:24&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:24&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;32&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:25&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:25&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;This, in conjunction with the increase in peer-to-peer networks of individual producers, and the likely prevalence of worker cooperatives, will likely force even the corporations that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; exist in the freed market to be far more beneficial to those who work for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this free market, there will be no official, privileged currency, which only a few banks have the right to inflate and which is the only valid legal tender for paying debts and taxes. Instead, individuals will be free to form mutual banks, and create and trade currency as they please. This will lead to low interest credit being available for all, instead of just the rich and powerful, and to the degree that there is inflation, it will be regulated by the market at large and used for the benefit of the majority, instead of hurting them.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:14:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:14&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:15:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:15&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:26&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:26&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:27&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:27&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:28&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:28&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;36&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This will make sure that low cost credit is far more available for individuals to acquire their own capital, without having to go to a capitalist, thereby increasing individual autonomy in the economy. It is also possible that credit, debt, and money will be totally different without a state.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:29&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:29&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conjunction with all of this, as well as free (and mutual) banking ensuring that inflation is used, when it exists at all, to benefit everyday individuals instead of the rich and powerful, and that everyone can get low-interest credit, the forces of individuals producing and trading private property, in other words, the free market, will tend strongly towards socialist ends.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:30&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:30&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:31&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:31&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:32&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:32&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;40&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:33&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:33&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;41&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:34&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:34&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;42&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  To quote from Kevin Carson:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The natural effect of unfettered market competition is socialism. For a short time the innovator receives a large profit, as a reward for  being first to the market. Then, as competitors adopt the innovation,  competition drives these profits down to zero and the price gravitates  toward the new, lower cost of production made possible by this  innovation (that price including, of course, the cost of the producer’s  maintenance and the amortization of her capital outlays). So in a free  market, the cost savings in labor required to produce any given  commodity would quickly be socialized in the form of reduced labor cost  to purchase it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Only when the state enforces artificial scarcities, artificial  property rights, and barriers to competition, is it possible for a  capitalist to appropriate some part of the cost savings as a permanent  rent. The capitalist, under these conditions, is enabled to engage in  monopoly pricing. That is, rather than being forced by competition to  price her goods at the actual cost of production (including her own  livelihood), she can target the price to the consumer’s ability to pay.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:15:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:15&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we would, hopefully at least, see an end to the strange, disjointed, and unhealthy individuals in our current society have with work itself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In theory, we can indeed eliminate  bullshit jobs, embrace automation, and shorten the individual work  schedule quite significantly and quite easily if not for the fact that  wages are not at living wage levels for a lot of people as is and  cutting their hours without compensation of some sort would hurt them  tremendously. Increased worker ownership would help solve some of this  problem since, as Wolff pointed out, worker cooperatives tend not to  fire workers, and thus if hours were shortened due to a decrease in  needed labor, the workers would still receive their same pay for the  same amount of production despite the decrease in needed labor. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:35&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:35&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;43&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I stand ready to negotiate, but I want no part of laws: I acknowledge none; &lt;strong&gt;I protest against every order with which some authority may feel pleased on the basis of some alleged necessity to over-rule my free will. Laws: We know what they are, and what they  are worth! They are spider webs for the rich and mighty, steel chains  for the poor and weak, fishing nets in the hands of government.&lt;/strong&gt; — Pierre-Joseph Proudhon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;71-general-statements&quot;&gt;7.1. General Statements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common objection levied against anarchists, which is probably now at the forefront of the minds of any who have read this treatise up till know, is that in the absence of the state, it is impossible to provide any stable order for society. After all, how can a community of individuals subject to no legitimized authority from above, which sets down uniform laws that govern how all may act, provide security and protection for its members, and prevent or solve conflicts? How will they know what to do, and what is to ensure that they do it, if there is no group of people to force them all to a single plan?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This objection is the product of limited thinking. In the absence of law — that top-down imposition of rules by an authority to govern the actions of all, legitimized as the ‘one true way’ — humans do not suddenly lose the ability to compromise with others in order to achieve peace and prosperous relations. They likewise do not lose their social capacity for good feelings: trust, empathy, etc. Least of all do they lose that common sense intuition for the game theory of interacting with others that allows most people to intuit the content of the two principles of my ethic when they are given time and mental space away from ‘the law’ to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An order that is founded on the autonomy of each individual participating in it, to recognize and compromise where necessary, convenient, or beneficial, and defend one’s own interests and the interests of others in like conditions, can be just as stable as — if not more stable than — an order founded on the top-heavy conception that all order must stem from authority and imposition, instead of compromise and stigmergy. After all, when power is distributed or decentralized, there is no one central locus of control that, if captured, brings the rest of society to its knees. There is no single failure point, and there are true ‘checks and balances,’ in a system where no one has any more control over the behavior and norms than any other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these general statements in mind, I think it is time to elaborate in more depth how protection and conflict resolution might be provided in a system without laws, given that the description of economic organization given above depends on some kind of coherent, stable order. Keep in mind that the same caveats about ‘planning’ an anarchist society that I voiced above are in full effect here: this is all speculation, and trying to state that this &lt;em&gt;must be&lt;/em&gt; how it will turn out, or trying to enforce such a result in an attempt to make it the only ‘legitimate’ option, would defeat the entire purpose of anarchism in the first place. I am merely presenting what I believe to be the most beneficial and probable methods of providing order to an anarchist society. Even within the context of these projection-suggestions, keep in mind that they will never be, and should never be, the sole source of legitimate decisions. There &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; no legitimacy or illegitimacy under anarchism, only what each individual thinks is correct, because there is no grant of authority to some standard, person, or group of people to decide what everyone says, thinks, or does regarding any matter, and the concept of a single legitimate outcome is a centralizing and hierarchical force itself. In the face of all these caveats, it is nonetheless interesting and sometimes profitable to speculate about how things might be done within the limits of a certain socio-ethical theory, so I will proceed with my analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;72-a-picture-of-order&quot;&gt;7.2. A Picture of Order&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first place, it should be noted that a reciprocal order, once established and understood, is stable in itself: each individual is motivated to continue cooperating with everyone else, even if they are not particularly interested in the cooperation of a specific person, because if they cease cooperation with that person, they might well lose cooperation from others. When they cease cooperation with someone, they run the risk of accruing a negative reputation: others become less sure of positive cooperation on their part being met with positive cooperation, making it less in their interest. If someone does not cooperate with your neighbor when it suits them not to, what is to guarantee that they will cooperate with you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, however, is actually a very forgiving system of enforcement, as it may take some time for someone’s reputation to be damaged enough to instill such doubts, meaning that a general loss of cooperation from the community, instead of just the individual harmed, won’t be immediate, preventing the whole network of reciprocal interactions from crumbling at the first violation. Additionally, this is a response that scales humanely with the severity and frequency of violations on the part of violator, as it operates on the basis of concerns for themselves and views on fairness on the part of the other members of the community, not some unilaterally instituted rule for punishment of violations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will probably not be an overly heavy-handed mechanism of ‘mob justice’ and enforcement of authoritarian social norms, either. After all, no community need be, or will be, wholly of the same mind on a matter. Some may choose to sanction someone for something, but others may choose not to, and it is in the interest of all not to take overly violent or enthusiastic action for fear of general cooperation breaking down. There is no single decided and legitimate outcome, even if a mediator is involved, so the community can arrive at a punishment stigmergically: if some believe others are punishing someone too harshly, they can try to lighten the load and vice versa, and the balance will be determined by the strength of either side’s convictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor would anyone who values autonomy attempt to use the forces of general social agreement to squash someone else’s autonomy, when a culture of doing so would likely hurt them just as much in the long run. Of course, general social oppression could not automatically be avoided in this way — anarchy is not a utopia — but neither is it avoided under the state, and at least absent a state, those oppressed will have no unilateral system making them behave nicely and peacefully toward their oppressors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not an overly light-handed mechanism for enforcement, either. If someone truly commits a serious crime, one which cannot be solved through restitution and restorative justice, and which demonstrates a serious danger to others in the community, there will be a strong incentive on the part of each individual embedded in the network that interacts with the criminal to take the necessary steps to protect themselves and each other. For instance, if there is a serial killer in our midst, it would be naturally in my interest to take it into my hands to put them out of their misery to prevent further harm to myself and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note, however, that this is not an inherently &lt;em&gt;legitimate&lt;/em&gt; action, the perpetration of which is protected from question and investigation. If some people think I shouldn’t have killed the person I did — perhaps they think I didn’t have the right person, or went about it the wrong way, or there were innocent casualties —I am now on the hook for that. There is no ‘qualified immunity’ in a stateless society!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, all of this runs the risk of fracturing the community around a particularly contentious crime, creating blood feuds and lasting, ongoing violence and damage, destroying the harmonious functioning of a reciprocal society. This is where mediators and investigators come in. Mediators are useful both for restoring conditions of peaceful positive cooperation between two or more individuals directly involved in a conflict, but they are also useful in the performative demonstration of listening to all sides of the story, and all sides’ interests, and constructing a narrative about what happened and what should happen next. Nobody will be bound to adhere to this narrative, there is no ‘official’ outcome, but nevertheless, in healing rifts and disagreements in communities, this is a crucial office. Perhaps it could be performed for money by some who specialize in it, or simply by someone whom the community views as sufficiently wise and neutral, or by several such people until an agreed-upon resolution is reached, I cannot say, but I do know that mediation is a crucial element here. Likewise, in aid of those mediators, investigators, who specialize in interviewing people, analyzing evidence, and so on, will likely be important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of a direct clustered network of reciprocal interactions, or in situations where there is low trust and low social knowledge, this process could be reified to some degree by mutual protection associations: in the event that one person is injured in some way, the rest of the organization agrees to participate in laying some sanction on the perpetrator (after establishing that their member is in the wrong, of course, to avoid an unnecessary expenditure of resources and social capital). This sanction could take the form of refusal to trade, ostracism, or even physical violence, and would probably be engaged in only if no restitution to their member was possible, or none was offered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it is likely that the perpetrator, if they were not so overly prone to crimes that no mutual protection association would commit to protecting them, would have their own protection association, who would want to protect their interests to some degree, even if they weren’t willing to commit fully to protecting them because they agreed that their member was in the wrong. Thus, it would be crucial, in order to avoid costly and possibly ongoing conflicts, to appeal to mediators who have a reputation for fairness, and to agree in contract to some resolution of the situation that is agreeable to both sides. Indeed, it might even be profitable for the purpose of stability to create contracts between associations before any conflict occurs, so that in the event of a conflict between two of their members, there is already an understood and respected procedure in place for handling matters. These contracts might include a mutual understanding of what counts as a violation (different from the rules the associations enforce within their ranks, if they do so at all), what to do in such cases, procedures for establishing guilt and the extent of harm, and procedures concerning the limits of restitution and retribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mutual protection associations would not need to be a solely out-facing phenomena, either. Providing mediation and an established code of norms between their members, democratically decided-upon, might be a quite useful service. This would be superior to how the state provides such services in that the association is non-hierarchical and directly accountable to each of its members, and also because it would be possible to leave an association without legitimate ramifications enshrined in institutions, laws, and society, such as having to leave behind one’s home and property, or being killed or imprisoned for treason. This ability to leave means that, by and large, no individual need be governed by rules that they do not agree to; the only concessions they need make is to other people who do not agree to live by the same rules, but even then that is not required, only motivated in order to avoid conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, in this vision of conflict resolution, every side has allies in a conflict representing and supporting their interests to one degree or another. There is not a single organization that enforces a single mold of ‘justice’ from above onto the community as a whole. Instead, it is merely the interaction of people, on relatively the same footing, figuring out agreements about conduct and resolutions to conflicts as best suits them, with all of the local information and context at their disposal. This egalitarian view of justice, where it is imposed by incentives and equal individuals, instead of something from on high, is bolstered by its decentralized nature. If every person is, in effect, a law unto themselves, and there is no recognized legitimate set of rules or punishments beyond what those involved agree on, there is no single apparatus that can be seized in order to inflict one’s will on others. Even if a whole mutual protection association ‘goes rogue’ and refuses to cooperate with others, the rest of the society can band against it and crush it under their greater numbers. And if an association begins to abuse its members — which is unlikely, given that the members are the ones who control the actions of such an association, and the purpose of the organization is not one that even remotely requires hierarchy — it is in the interest of the other associations to step in to defend the minority members of that association thus abused in order to gain their loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that in such a society, it would profit no one to have prisons. If those who want to hold people in prisons must pay for the cost of doing so, they will quickly realize that they are only further hurting themselves, after whatever harm the perpetrator of the harm did, in order to get revenge on the prisoner. Why commit to this course of action, when it is even remotely possible to reintegrate people back into society, since once they are thus reintegrated there is no ongoing cost, and perhaps some ongoing benefits?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus we arrive at a patchwork view of social order, where most ‘law’ is provided by merely the necessity of living with other humans and avoiding, or satisfactorily ending, conflicts. For the most part, institutionalized order will not be necessary, as the Nash equilibrium of social order does its work. Order will reinforce itself, and ‘law’, as embodied in agreements, will be fluid, built and destroyed as needed, and individualized to the specific relevant case. In the few occasions where such institutions are needed, they will be radically egalitarian and decentralized, ensuring that there is competition and free agreement as much as possible for everyone, and that everyone’s interests are represented. This is what I call &lt;strong&gt;the reciprocal order.&lt;/strong&gt; As Proudhon says, liberty (autonomy) is “not the daughter, but the mother of order.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;81-the-state-as-a-force-of-decay-and-atomization&quot;&gt;8.1. The State as A Force of Decay and Atomization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the striking features of the reciprocal order is that in it, everyone’s interests are represented; order is preserved and conflicts are resolved on a horizontal plane, between equals, where there is not one single verdict or outcome that is universally true or correct. This is in stark contrast to the law of the State, which is enforced from above: each side appeals to a third party (the State) instead of to each other, and it does not matter what &lt;em&gt;either&lt;/em&gt; side thinks the correct outcome is, nor what everyone else involved in the conflict thinks the outcome should be; only what the State believes is best matters. It is the State’s sole power to perform unilateral action against those it deems ‘guilty’ without repercussions or consideration for the interests of the guilty party. Often, this hurts all parties to the conflict, since the State, being a representative always ultimately only of itself, and which can enforce whatever it so desires without considering the interests of either person, has no interest in making the victim whole again, in restitution or making life return to a cooperative balance. No, it punishes the ‘guilty’ party because they have offended it, and makes the victim pay for it, and leaves both the worse for wear. It leaves the ‘criminal’ with no pathway to joining society again, and therefore little incentive to avoid committing crimes anymore — after all, they will suffer either way, because they are forever marked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the important things to realize is that the very existence of the State not only violates the rules of the reciprocal order, but, as touched on in earlier sections, causes it to decay. After all, if your treatment is not up to your neighbors and those you interact with, but is enforced from above (whether you are treated with respect, or punished), one has little interest or care for what others think of you or how you treat them. If you treat someone poorly, and get away with it, &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; may know what you have done, but what can they do to you that the State will not stop? Hence the very existence of a top-down order of Law destroys much of the inherent interest we have in treating each other well, building trust and communities and relationships, outside of the State and what it can enforce, which is surprisingly little when it comes to the actual harm against people. After all, it is in the State’s direct interest to enforce the collection of taxes and other such laws that benefit those in power, but as for actually protecting the people? They care little for that; after all, the people will placidly accept pretty much whatever they do, believing in the lie of the legitimacy of the organization that oppresses them. What little they do care for protecting the individual stems from doing just enough to preserve the fictional legitimacy they hold. They have even made this clear:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Neither the Constitution, nor state law, impose a  general duty upon police officers or other governmental officials to  protect individual persons from harm — even when they know the harm will occur,” said Darren L. Hutchinson, a professor and associate dean at  the University of Florida School of Law. “Police can watch someone  attack you, refuse to intervene and not violate the Constitution.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the government has only a  duty to protect persons who are “in custody,” he pointed out.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:36:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:36&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The State also frays the reciprocal order by its very existence in other ways. For one thing, it is a tool of immense power to enact any social or economic change any group wishes to see. Once a State is introduced into society, the race is on to see who can capture it first in order to bend everyone else to their will, be it ‘benevolent’ or not. Worse, every side must compete all the harder for control over the Ring of Power that is the State because, were their enemies, or even those with simply a different vision of the world than they, to seize control of it, it would be worse for them than if no one had control of the State! Thus, by its very existence the State fosters an endless war of all against all for control of the apparatus of power. All the while, of course, those who seek nothing more than power and are willing to do anything to get it hide behind the fiction of legitimacy, social contracts, and constitutions as slowly strangle their society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a state already in place to defend property that others have little interest in respecting otherwise, and to give them privileges, monopolies, and subsidies, it will be difficult for anyone to become too rich, especially on the backs of exploited others, and so it will be exponentially more difficult for any one person to become powerful enough to institute a state themselves. Indeed, to become rich, one would need to already be rich in order to put together what is necessary to defend and acquire the riches one intends to gain, unless one really intends to engage in a war against everyone else. Hence, in a society with no respect for authority, and respect for other’s autonomy only if it is reciprocated and only if it does not severely curtail their own, it will be almost impossible for Kings, Presidents, or Ministers to ever arise again. Thus, the reciprocal order protects itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;82-the-state-and-culture&quot;&gt;8.2. The State and Culture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, this vision of a possible society as a mesh network of individual peers interacting reciprocally relies on the majority of the people in it sharing certain cultural beliefs concerning legitimacy, authority, and hierarchy. This is not a difficulty unique to an anarchist order, though: all power structures ultimately rest on public opinion. Whatever the public views as illegitimate ultimately crumbles and falls away, and whatever it sees as legitimate is raised up in response. The state cannot exist if its citizens do not placidly submit to its auspices, either crying its praises or mumbling about how it is a ‘necessary evil’ and there is no other option but to accept it. If its citizens refuse to cooperate with it, to lend it their compliance and their support, it will be paralyzed: it will be a few oligarchs and politicians sitting around a table giving orders futilely to people who will not listen to their ranting and raving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply because a man declares himself king or president, it does not become so; most must accept his rule as law, and some must flock to him to enforce his will against the few that dissent. If all dissent, even excepting those few enforcers, where is his power? To quote Etienne de la Boetie, from &lt;em&gt;Discourse of Voluntary Servitude&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Poor, wretched, and stupid peoples, nations determined on your own  misfortune and blind to your own good! You let yourselves be deprived  before your own eyes… You live in such a way that you cannot claim a single thing as your own; and it  would seem that you consider yourselves lucky to be loaned your  property, your families, and your very lives. All this havoc, this  misfortune, this ruin, descends upon you not from alien foes, but from  the one enemy whom you yourselves render as powerful as he is, for whom you go bravely to war, for whose greatness you do not refuse to offer your own bodies unto death.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;He who thus domineers over you has only two eyes, only two hands, only one body, no more than is possessed by the least man among the infinite numbers dwelling in your cities; he has indeed nothing more than the power that you confer upon him to destroy you. Where has he acquired enough eyes to spy upon you, if you do not provide them yourselves? How can he have so many arms to beat you with, if he does not borrow them from you? The feet that trample down your cities, where does he get them if they are not your own? How does he  have any power over you except through you? How would he dare assail you if he had no cooperation from you? What could he do to you if you  yourselves did not connive with the thief who plunders you, if you were not accomplices of the murderer who kills you, if you were not traitors to yourselves?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;From all these indignities, such as the very beasts of the field would not endure, you can deliver yourselves if you try, not by taking action, but merely by willing to be free. &lt;strong&gt;Resolve to serve no more, and you are at  once freed. I do not ask that you place hands upon the tyrant to topple him over, but simply that you support him no longer; then you will behold him, like a great Colossus whose pedestal has been pulled away, fall of his own weight and break in pieces.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:43:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:43&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ask why anarchy was overtaken by states in the long past is the same as asking why democracy did not form before monarchy: in both cases the question ignores the changing cultural factors that make different power structures possible in the first place. The form of anarchy that humans had in the deep past was based on tribal chieftains, patriarchs and matriarchs, it was not averse to hierarchy and authority, merely not populous enough yet to support the more rigid kinds of it. It was not an ideological anarchy, an anarchy supported by cultural norms against rulers and bolstered by an understanding of the proper ways to organize a decentralized, distributed society. It was anarchy born out of the fact that society was not ready for kings yet. So when society was ready for kings, they took over easily. The cultural beliefs were not ready to support stable anarchy against the impositions of rulers. Likewise, democracy did not form before monarchy because the cultural beliefs behind it, about the equality of all, and government being a representative of the collective will for the collective defense, the ideas of social contract theory, had not yet begun to form, let alone percolate into society. Democracy &lt;em&gt;could not&lt;/em&gt; have formed before those ideas came about, because the culture would not have accepted and maintained it. In the places where something like modern democracy did form, such as Athens, it was precisely because the culture there believed it to be legitimate, and did not believe kings to be so. Likewise, stable anarchy &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; form before the ideas in it percolate similarly. Therefore it is no more a criticism of democracy’s stability that it did not form as soon as more than two humans got together, than that stable anarchy did not. Not all ages of history are interchangeable: simply because something did not arise then, does not mean it cannot arise now, because &lt;em&gt;culture matters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus the two most common criticisms of anarchism, first that it is dependent on predominant cultural values, and second that it has not already occurred in history, are shown to grow from the same core fallacy: ignoring the power that public cultural opinion has over &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; things. The statist order is just as subject to the whims of the people as an anarchist one, and the existence of both is defined and limited to the time period in which the cultural values that make them legitimate exist. Monarchy’s time is past, democracy’s time is now, and anarchy’s time is the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also forms the basis of a response to another common objection to anarchy, as opposed to the state. Under the rule of the state, I hear it said, this or that can be achieved by enough people voting in favor of it. Thus, the state’s existence brings about an assurance that certain things can be done. The state can be used to prevent bigotry, to provide for the poor, and other such things. What, under anarchy, can be done? To answer this, it one must realize that someone asking this question is hiding the ball: if there are enough people to &lt;em&gt;vote&lt;/em&gt; for something, there are enough people to contribute to actually doing it directly. If the majority of society is able to vote successfully to end bigotry — than most of society isn’t bigoted. If most of society wants a social safety net, than most of society can organize into a federation of mutual aid organizations to provide for each other. Whatever the democratic state does for the people, it does on the basis of the majority’s desire for it to do that thing (that is not to say that it &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; or even &lt;em&gt;often&lt;/em&gt; does what the people want), and whatever the democratic state can do, the people who vote can do directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;9-conclusion-praxis&quot;&gt;9. Conclusion: Praxis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have arrived at the truth, but most people are still deluded believers in error; therefore, we must educate these people — via lectures, discussions, books, pamphlets, newspapers, or whatever — until  they become converted to the correct point of view. For a minority to  become a majority, a process of persuasion and conversion must take  place — in a word, education.&lt;br /&gt;
— Murray Rothbard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Beneath the governmental machinery, in the shadow of political  institutions, out of the sight of statesmen and priests, society is  producing its own organism, slowly and silently; and constructing a new  order, the expression of its vitality and autonomy, and the denial of  the old politics, as well as of the old religion.&lt;br /&gt;
— Pierre-Joseph Proudhon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how do we get from here to there? How would a set of individuals committed to an ethic of reciprocity and the society envisioned therein ensure that the social norms and cultural knowledge are in place to support a transition from the  &lt;em&gt;status quo&lt;/em&gt; to an order based on an ethic of reciprocity? There are three things such a group (‘we’ from here on) must do, and two it must not. The road I endorse is long and difficult, but I think it is ultimately worth it for anyone committed to the ideas of autonomy, individualism, and peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing we must do is to educate others. Reveal to them the brutality of the state and its illegitimacy; tear down the curtains of the temple of ‘legitimate’ authority and show everyone the feeble little man that works the controls behind them; show that we need not choose between individual freedom and subjugation to the powerful on the one hand, and individual bondage to the collective on the other; explain how freed markets work and how things can be done without the state; explain a proper ethic of life and rid the minds of our neighbors of the propaganda bogymen that haunt them. This education will provide the soil from which all else must grow. All that is necessary for the state to wither, and a stable order of liberty to grow in its place, is that enough of us reject concepts alien to individual autonomy and embrace reciprocity; we must retract the prostrate acceptance of the &lt;em&gt;status quo&lt;/em&gt; that allows it to run roughshod over us without objection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing we must do is build: build alternative organizations, alternative methods of doing things here and now, under the capitalist, statist system, as best we can. A purely intellectual, purely destructive or deconstructive movement is infertile, fallow. We must instead demonstrate that our methods and theories work, insofar as we can, and learn the practical knowledge that will be necessary to construct a stable and functional order in the absence of a state. This positive, constructive, practical action, which can help people even in the present, will draw people to our cause, and prepare society for when, or if, the state does indeed wither away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third thing we must do is &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt;. No theory is ever complete, because humans are not omniscient. We must not let theory become stagnant dogma, not open to revision or improvement in light of new ideas or new data. We must also let our theories interface with their opposites, their competitors, and their counterpoints. All the best ideas, in my experience, arise from a synthesis of many different sources, each with their criticisms of each other. Thus our theories must exist in a constant state of dialectic refinement or it will die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two things we must &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; do, however. First, we must &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; enforce our ideas on others. I explained why in detail previously, but to reiterate: to force our ideas of social organization — either the absence of a state, or specific choices in that state’s absence — on others would be to defeat the entire purpose of allowing individuals full autonomy to explore their options. If a community chooses to not respect certain parts of autonomy, as long as they do so voluntarily, then it would be a violation of their autonomy to try to stop them. Perhaps it might be in our interests to avoid joining such a community or interacting with it, or even to help those who want to escape to do so, but there is no single plan for life and social organization that &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be followed, only ones that are better or worse for some goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, we must not become unduly violent. Violence begets violence, death begets death, and blood begets blood. A new order born in indiscriminate bloodshed will live and die by blood, because it breaks reciprocity and sets a standard for all to see and all to take advantage of in a race to the bottom — a race to death. Nor is it an attractive thing; it is primarily only those who are happy with violence, who revel in it, and who are looking for an excuse to do it will join a revolution of blood and death and stay with it. That is not what anyone who values peace, autonomy, and reciprocal cooperation wants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that this essay has, in its own small way, contributed to the education component of praxis. I know that it is not wholly original, but I hope that the method of presentation, and the specific arguments put forth here, having largely sprung from my own head, might provide an interesting perspective, and convince a few people who would not otherwise have been convinced. I do not envision the state crumbling today, or tomorrow, or the day after that. I do not envision the oligarchs relinquishing their golden-gloved grip on our throats easily. There is no quick change that we can effect. Yet, not deterred, I write this in service of a brighter, better tomorrow that &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; still be, that &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be. It may happen a decade hence, a century, a millennium; it may never happen; but as long as I am around I will try to increase the chances that it does. I hope that those who share my values, or come to share them, will join with me in doing likewise.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;In the market as it currently is today, inflation has two harmful effects on the working class and poor. Firstly, as inflation goes on, prices rise, as corporations are more than willing to raise prices in order to get more profits. This does not translate to workers’ wages, however: corporations are far less motivated to raise wages, only motivated to do so by the competition of other corporations, and so if they can they won’t do so. Inflation, and the common ignorance of people regarding it, provides a signal that can be used to form essentially a wage cartel without any centralized planning or direction, as corporations refuse to raise wages, and so prices go up while wages largely stagnate. Moreover, inflated money is not air-dropped evenly throughout the economy, so those who get the new money first (the rich and powerful) get to spend it at pre-inflation prices, but as it circulates through the economy those who get it later benefit from it less and less, until it eventually gets to the poor, who have been paying the higher, inflated prices for a long time, and only now get a commensurate increase in wages (if they even do). &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:26&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-introduction&quot;&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important role of philosophy, in the present scientific age, is that of a diagnostician and prescriptionist for the human condition. The rest of philosophy is either subservient to science, or made obsolete by it. All the great old metaphysical systems have fallen before modern physics, and new ones must gain their premises from it; the conceptual and logical analysis of the classical analytic philosophers finds its primary usefulness in helping science on its way; even epistemology is only useful insofar as it explains the formidable effectiveness of science or suggests incremental improvements to it. Only in the sphere of phenomenology, ethics, and the human condition — the sphere of &lt;em&gt;existential concerns&lt;/em&gt; — is philosophy still the prime mover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This revolutionary fact has, in a way, been recognized even by the mainstream community of academic philosophers; but, alas, they have responded incorrectly to it. Instead of focusing all their efforts on this last frontier of philosophic inquiry where science has not, and probably cannot, encroach, they have retreated in the opposite direction, becoming &lt;em&gt;historians of philosophy&lt;/em&gt;. They do not produce new systems, or reconcile the good components of old ones; they merely produce hermeneutic excavations. Even in the way philosophy is taught, this retreat can be seen. Gone are the days — if they ever existed, since formal training in philosophy began when the production of new philosophy was already on the decline —when students of philosophy are expected to actually &lt;em&gt;produce&lt;/em&gt; new philosophy, even late in their careers.  No, they are taught to learn what others thought, to put things in the terms of minds previous to, and therefore assumed to be greater than, theirs. Philosophy is, in fact, taught backwards: from the oldest and worst philosophies, to the newest and most robust and intellectually nuanced. Many never even reach that final stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, however, refuse to take the route that mainstream academic philosophy takes. I will freely admit that I am self-taught, and perhaps not the most well-read in primary sources. I will also freely admit that I may not be the most intelligent person to ever set their mind to philosophy. Nevertheless, I have only one mind to think with, and that is my own, and it tells me to set out upon this project, because too few besides me are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what is this project? Merely this: to produce an analysis of the human condition, a diagnosis of it, if you will, and then prescribe a possible solution to those problems. The task of the normative philosopher, like the doctor, is simply to explain to their audience what the problems are that are preventing them from achieving what they want, and methods they can use to achieve it. The patient complains to the doctor that something feels wrong, something is off; the doctor inspects them, asks them for specifics about how they feel, and eventually concludes: ah, here is your malady, and here is the solution. The normativity of this prescription comes from the already-felt, indelible desire of the patient for relief, and the choices the patient themselves make about how to move forward. Likewise, the normative philosopher — the philosopher whose concerns are existential ones — examines what it means to be a human, and prescribes solutions, when they can, for the problems and contradictions inherent in that condition; they are problems precisely because the desire for their alleviation is already felt, and therefore the normativity of his prescription may be had, as it were, for “free.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary challenge in the work of the normative philosopher is that of subjectivity. We, each of us, have access only to our own phenomena, mediated by our own situated existence and facticity; we must, therefore, be eternally vigilant that we do not mistake an aspect of our own condition that is unique to us for one that is universal and therefore a part of the human condition. A differentiation can be made, in many cases — there are &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; implications in what it means to be a thinking, conscious, curious, reasoning agent with a limited experience of the world, which has desires and must interact with the world in such a way as to bring them about — but doing that differentiation is far more difficult than any mathematical one, and far more prone to error. Thus the normative philosopher must proceed carefully, cautiously, and with a steady eye towards phenomenology and epistemology, and must always make their conclusions tentative. This is the core difficulty in diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The secondary challenge in the work of a normative philosopher is obvious: the challenge of prescription. It is often thought that once a problem is made clear, its solution is likewise made obvious. This is wishful thinking. Even the most clearly described problem may be intractable or even insoluble. Conversely, sometimes, a problem is not a problem at all: the problem only presents itself because of a deeper mistake in assumptions, expectations, or knowledge, and once that deeper problem is solved, the other problem will dissipate like the vapor it was. Furthermore, the solution to a certain problem might precisely lie in the fact that there is no set solution, that a solution must be generated by the will of each of us, and this might be done in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus the diagnosis of and prescription for the human condition’s ailments is a fearsome task, and it may seem vain — both in the sense of narcissism, and in the sense of being doomed to failure — to embark on it; all the moreso for one like myself. Nevertheless, it is a worthy cause. I, like any good doctor, cannot see a patient — all of humanity in my case — so wracked by pain and sorrow and yet turn away from at least attempting treatment. And make no mistake: the human condition is painful and sorrowful by nature. Many have found anesthetics for this pain, but few have found true solutions, and when they do those solutions are invariably too specific to be of general application. I want to present, as best I can, the first few steps on the long path of thought which, I hope, might lead to a true solution more general, unified, and effective than the ones which humans forced to live life and find a way through it have found but not shared or failed to share. It will be constructed from the pieces of prescriptions offered by philosophers before me, and things pulled from my own mind and experience; however, it is all so blended together in my embryonic system that to attempt to cite and quote where each idea has been pulled from would be an exercise in futility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-the-method-of-determining-universal-facts-of-the-human-condition&quot;&gt;2. The Method of Determining Universal Facts of the Human Condition&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first question of the diagnostician must be: what are the facts concerning this patient which I am to be diagnosing? Therefore if I am to diagnose the human condition, in a like manner I must first understand the facts about it. In other words, I must somehow gain access to facts that are true of the condition of all humans, since “the human condition” is an abstraction, a collective noun, for the condition of all individual humans. This will necessarily be a smaller set of facts than the facts about any individual human condition, just as the facts that are true of an abstraction from many particulars are never as numerous as the facts that are true of a given particular, because some of the true facts concerning those particulars must vary between them — to differentiate them and hence &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; them particulars — and the facts that amongst the set must be left out of the description of the entire set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this I can conclude that the facts which are true of my own human condition are a superset of the facts that are true of &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; human condition. The rest of the methodology for abstraction described above, however, is unfortunately pretty much useless. After all, we do not have access to the internal phenomenological facts of other human beings. We have access only to our own phenomena. Therefore, I must, as I described in the introduction, proceed by a different route: instead of attempting to document the facts of as many particular human conditions as I can discover, and draw up an abstraction from that, I must instead begin with my own particular human condition, and discover what truths concerning it are &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; products of being a being like myself and which are products of my situatedness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key question, therefore, is how to differentiate the two categories of facts. I propose that the basis of this differentiation should still be observation. Instead of observing all the categories of facts that are true of the internal phenomenological experience of the human condition of every individual human being, and then sifting through that list to find the common facts, I will instead observe the external existence of human beings, and compare it to my own external existence. Then, on the basis of conceptual analysis of the necessary implications of such an external existence and an analysis of the correspondences between aspects of &lt;em&gt;my own&lt;/em&gt; external existence and interior experience, I can determine what shared properties can be found between my interior experience and that of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-the-facts-of-the-human-condition&quot;&gt;3. The Facts of the Human Condition&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;31-consciousness-and-thrownness&quot;&gt;3.1. Consciousness and Thrownness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary fact of human existence seems to be that of our subjectivity: our awareness as subjects perceiving objects. Without this awareness, there would be no content to our experience or existence, no components with which to compose thoughts or anything else. We would, in essence, not exist as conscious beings at all, because to be conscious is to be conscious &lt;em&gt;of something&lt;/em&gt;. Without awareness of objects, it would be impossible to perform any task, including writing this essay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, however, there is a split in this consciousness. For, while human subjectivity can serve as its own object — in what we call self-awareness or introspection — there must be subjectivity there in the first place to be aware of, and for subjectivity to be present, there must be an object to be aware of. Hence, without grounding the chain of introspection in a first step where subjective awareness is aware of an object that is not itself, we cannot begin the process of introspection, because there is no subjectivity to ever form the object of further subjective awareness in the first place. Without subjective awareness of external objects, there would be nothing to be aware of internally, when we turn our subjectivity on itself as its own object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; basic fact of our own human existence is not merely our awareness of objects of consciousness in general, but specifically our awareness of external objects. Everything else — introspection and self-awareness — is built upon that foundation and makes no sense without it. This means that the fundamental fact of human existence is our embeddedness in a larger world that is outside our direct control by means of thought. The first and most important thing about humans is that we are thrust into a world we have no choice but to perceive and interact with — our unavoidable thrownness (&lt;em&gt;Geworfenheit&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;32-the-second-fact-dual-consciousness&quot;&gt;3.2. The Second Fact: Dual Consciousness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the first fact, a new fact emerges: there is a foundational split in human consciousness between direct subjectivity, which is conscious merely of external objects, and indirect subjectivity, which is conscious of itself and of itself being conscious in turn of other things. The former part of consciousness is the egoistic layer (or mode) of consciousness, and the latter the narrative layer (or mode). It is still the same apparatus of subjectivity that is being used for both, so these layers are not strictly separate but instead are two modes of the same thing, but it is useful to think of them as layers (that are, nevertheless, interwoven into a moebius strip of feedback loops), as the two modes of subjectivity occur nearly simultaneously when they are both in play and rapidly switch back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first component of consciousness is where our motivations and deepest desires come from: the direct awareness of pleasure and pain and states of the world, the immediate communion with surrounding facts. It is also what generates impulses to act pursuant of these deeply held desires — not merely in reflexes, as one might mistakenly think, but in more complex actions as well. This is the consciousness that we have when totally focused on a single task, whether it be swimming or a game of chess. It is the component of consciousness driven purely to achieve desires by any means possible — the egoistic layer of consciousness. This is the layer that humans most share with the other animals, although we have a much more complex and powerful version of it because of our capacity for language and reasoning. This is the sort of awareness that we have when our ability for self-reflection is (usually temporarily) stripped from us, in intense situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second component of consciousness is the layer that watches other layers as an object — the process that occurs when subjectivity is turned upon itself. The second layer sees the first layer (and itself) as objects that are as foreign and external, in a sense, as any other external object, since that is the necessary product of the alienating subject-object relation, and attempts to draw conclusions about them and meld them into a single cohesive theory about the self. It, essentially, tries to weave all the facts of its existence into a single cohesive whole, so as to portray itself as a single, consistent entity which endures through time and change. This is, in a sense, a fiction, but in a sense a truth, as the brain and body that is identical with the human being does persist through time as a single object. This layer weaves a narrative that is as true as it is false, a story to tell itself about itself and what it is, its history, impulses, actions, and desires. This is, therefore, a layer that is fundamentally &lt;em&gt;narrative&lt;/em&gt; and abductive in nature, because it does not have perfect access to the lower layer. It cannot actually perceive its own deepest desires, the ones held in the egoistic layer, and so instead must make guesses as to what its desires are through past feelings and impulses to action. This is why people can be wrong about what they desire: what they desire happens at a deeper level than the operation that attempts to examine and explicate this desire, and is out of its reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The narrative process also examines the objects of experience that the egoistic process takes in, by noticing that the egoistic process is perceiving things and understanding what it is perceiving, and attempts to integrate them into the narrative story that it is telling about itself as a conscious entity. Each object of experience thereby acquires a “meaning” or “purpose” relative to the agent. This feature of the narrative process will be discussed in more detail later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is only through the second layer that more complex reasoning can occur, as one examines one’s own thought processes for correctness and consciously mulls over and integrates what one knows. It is also only due to the narrative layer that human beings are capable of planning, by viewing themselves as an object which can be hypothetically divorced from the self doing the thinking and given different properties (greater age, hunger, etc) and then placed into hypothetical situations. It is also this second layer which allows the deeper communication with others of explaining thoughts and emotional states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These layers, as I said earlier, are not strictly separate, however. The egoistic process that happens at the lower layer of consciousness receives some of its plans for action and desires from the analysis that the narrative process performs, and the narrative process only runs at the behest of the desires of the egoistic process, just like everything else in the human body besides the autonomic systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;33-thought&quot;&gt;3.3. Thought&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After mere awareness, or observation, of an object of consciousness comes thought. The connection between the two — awareness and thought — is often so close that the two are confused for each other, yet they are not one and the same. As those skilled in meditating will tell you, and your own occasional experience will likely confirm, it is possible to be truly and totally aware of an object without thinking anything about it. Likewise, it is possible to have fewer or more numerous thoughts concerning an object of awareness, demonstrating the separation between the two. Nevertheless, the two are also closely related: thoughts concerning objects are generated automatically from the awareness of an object. Awareness takes place in both the egoistic and narrative processes of consciousness (because consciousness is defined by the awareness of things, no matter what process or layer it is), whereas thought occurs only in the narrative process, because only in the narrative process is it possible to analyze objects of experience at an distanced, abstract level, and think about things in relation to oneself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a thought is generated in the narrative process, in relation to some object of perception, that thought itself can become an object of perception for the narrative process as it turns on itself, and since whenever the narrative process perceives or is aware of anything it generates thoughts related to that thing, when this thought becomes an object of the narrative processes’ perception, it automatically generates a new thought. These thoughts are related by subject, or by logical or probabilistic entailment. These thoughts are then also integrated into the narrative that this process is constructing about itself as a single cohesive entity — and when thoughts cannot be so integrated, such as with intrusive thoughts, it is jarring and even psychologically distressing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, this process of thought generation is not “volitional.” One does not choose what one thinks: one must follow one’s own inner logic from one thought to the next, must follow the clear truth of the thoughts derived from awareness. One can choose to “think something” in the sense of conjuring a random phrase in the mind, but one cannot choose what one thinks is true, right, what follows from one’s thoughts. There is volition in the human subject that is an indelible component of our experience — whatever metaphysical truth undergirds it — but it is not to be found here. &lt;strong&gt;The domain of thought is the domain of a mechanical process for the production and weaving of more thoughts; a thinking person, if they pay attention carefully, will realize that they are being carried along helplessly by the flow.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;34-desire&quot;&gt;3.4. Desire&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next fundamental fact of the human condition is desire. This is perhaps the most important component from a practical standpoint, as desire is the source of all suffering and all fulfillment, and thereby source of the normative force of any advice or ethical judgment that could be given. Desire is that impulse, instinct, inclination, or sense of value in virtue of which choices are made and experiences evaluated. Desire is a fundamental part of the human existence because all of our existence requires choice. The choices of what to focus our awareness on, the choice to act in order to preserve our lives (or not), how to act, and even the choice not to think. Choice is inescapable. As Sartre said, we are “condemned to be free.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of subjectivity is selective — there is intentionality to human perception, thought, and awareness, we are not simply passive receivers of all of the available sensory information, nor is our sensory apparatus omnidirectional and impartial — there must be some factor which directs our sensory apparatus and limits, within the range of sensory input it gives us, what we are primarily aware of. Desire is what performs this function: it is our current paramount desires that determine how we direct our subjective awareness (towards what and in what scope), and what objects of that awareness are most immediately sensed and seen as relevant. Thus, under normal conditions, we perceive objects that are relevant to our desires first, and these only insofar as they help or hinder desires, and only in their capacity as tools or obstacles. We view things, under normal conditions, therefore, in terms of purpose or goal: what is the purpose of this object to me? How does this object relate to my goal? Everything else forms a paler backdrop, which we do perceive, but is mostly filtered out of conscious, active interest and awareness, and almost entirely filtered out of the process of automatic thought generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We even perceive ourselves only when we ourselves are tools or obstacles to our own progress toward desired ends, which is why embarrassment is such a good tool for inducing self-consciousness: suddenly our very existence in that moment of embarrassment becomes a hindrance to our goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is only when some oddity startles us that we fall out of this mode of thinking. When our desire changes from goals embedded in the world, to meta-goals: goals about our goals or goals about our thinking. It is only when my goal shifts from whatever mundane task is before me currently to perceiving the world around me that suddenly I see every object in perfect clarity, as itself, instead of as a tool or obstacle. Even then, I am still seeing every object in relation to a desire; it is merely that the desire has changed, and so perception of the objects as honestly as I am capable of perceiving them is now the best way they can serve as a tool, and every object can thus serve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, we only view people as more than complex and volatile tools worthy of careful interaction and respect in order to get what we want out of them when our emotions suddenly well up in us and jar us out of such thinking. Again, however, this is because the goal has changed; empathy or compassion has made my goal to see this person as a being like myself, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like for thought, there is no volition at the roots of desire. Some desires — some set of desires or some single desire — must form the concrete foundation for all our other desires, for, to choose a desire, I must have a desire regarding what desires I have, in order to have a basis for that choice. Thus if all desires were volitional, there would be an infinite regress of them, an infinite regress that is impossible to resolve in a finite mind and finite time. This implies that, to be as happy as possible, the first task of every human being is to discover these immutable desires. These base level desires must be accommodated, because they themselves cannot accommodate anything else. They are also the ones most deeply and powerfully felt, as they provide the justification for all other things, all other thoughts, choices, and desires. But, again, we will discuss this later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say “discover” in the foregoing paragraph because, by default, the desires inherent in our minds are unarticulated and hidden from our understanding, manifest at the egoistic layer of consciousness. We are not directly aware of our desires at all — we are merely aware, after the fact, of whether something we did satisfied a desire or not. There is a reward mechanism embedded in the egoistic layer of consciousness, as I have said before, which doles out pleasure and pain in accordance with its nature. There is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a table of articulated and specific desires written in language on our minds. That &lt;em&gt;could not be the case&lt;/em&gt;, because humans are not born with the capacity for language, and our motive power in desires needed to exist before we even had the capability of learning language. Any conscious sense of the desire that we have is a reconstruction performed by the narrative layer of consciousness, as it observes after the fact the whole history of rewards and punishments that the egoistic layer of consciousness doles out, and tries to reason out its best guess at what the the whole being wants inductively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, then, we can think of human perception as a series of consecutive filters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First, we receive sensory information, the direction, range, and depth of which is mediated by the desires present in the egoistic layer of consciousness.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Next, our brain parses these sensory inputs into an intelligible array of objects and entities, focused around what objects we can pick up or manipulate, since those objects are the ones most likely to be candidates for satisfying our desires.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After that, our brain uses the set of our most prominent and active desires at that moment to filter the list of objects most present and vivid in our awareness down to the ones that are directly relevant to the satisfaction of our desires or the hindrance thereof, and invest them with the relevant “metadata” concerning how they relate to us, our desires, and their context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, although desires are primarily a phenomenon of the egoistic layer of consciousness, what we know in the narrative layer of consciousness, in terms of the context of these objects, their relation to ourselves and others, our past experiences of the objects, and our knowledge about the use of those objects, is relevant to the selection of what subset of the perceived objects get primarily presented to conscious awareness, so our consciousness must switch into its narrative mode of operation concerning almost every object which passes the first two filters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, since the narrative and egoistic layers of consciousness are more &lt;em&gt;modes&lt;/em&gt; of operation for a single entity than separate entities which can call to each other with specific and delimited requests, this switch in order to consult what the narrative layer knows concerning every object in our awareness brings with it the rest of its method of processing, meaning that other memories about objects (or considerations of their meaning and relation to ourselves, etc.) that are not directly relevant to the object’s use to us in satisfying or hindering desires, are often brought into our awareness. This will be important later in my analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;35-temporal-existence&quot;&gt;3.5. Temporal Existence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dual nature of consciousness also reveals the essentially temporal, and temporally interlinked, nature of human consciousness. After all, if subjectivity exists only when given an object, and subjectivity must already exist for it to serve as its own object, then we are faced with a question: how is self-reflection possible at all? For, if we turn the attention of the subject away from an external object and toward itself, does it not cease to exist in that very moment, and therefore cease to be a possible subject for itself? The solution to this question is simple: memory. When we turn our awareness upon itself, we are not turning it upon its current self, but upon the awareness &lt;em&gt;just past&lt;/em&gt; and preserved for us in memory. Thus all self-reflection is actually past-reflection; the delay is only so brief that it matters little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desire, like self-awareness, is also a necessarily temporal component of human experience: it is al ways oriented toward something which is not, at present, possessed or fulfilled, and since the human being is forever being thrust forward through time, the only temporal epoch in which it is possible to satisfy a desire is the future. It is only in the future of the desire that one may act, and only in the future of that action when a change in the state of the world toward the desired one can be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;36-the-desire-for-meaning&quot;&gt;3.6. The Desire For Meaning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The human world is full of meaning, richly embroidered into the fabric of everything that we experience in the same way that desire is, &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of desire, as explained in &lt;strong&gt;section 3.4&lt;/strong&gt;. Upon turning our attention onto any given thing, thoughts spring up in our narrative consciousness as it is consulted concerning that thing. When this happens, the narrative process cannot help but weave that object into a story in relation to ourselves, our character, and our history, instead of simply serving up the information needed for the rich perceptual apparatus to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I see a chair, it is difficult to see it except in the context of the other chairs I have known, the purpose I know the chair is meant to serve, how I have used the chair in the past,  who uses the chair normally and my relation to them (or whether I am that person), etc, because all these things effect how my rich perceptual apparatus should present it to me, if it should present it at all. Even the word — chair — is associated with the object and with the necessary context that establishes that that word refers to this object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also impossible to perceive any object except as it relates to oneself — spatially, temporally, in likeness and unlikeness. Try, for instance, imagining a chair that has no relation to oneself — not a certain distance away, not a certain relative size. Just a chair. It is impossible. In the mind’s eye, just as in reality, any conception of an object of awareness is necessarily in relation to oneself. Similarly, but on a more abstact level, moreover, I also become “the person who saw that chair”, and the narrative consciousness notes that “&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; saw a chair today,” even if these entries into its running narrative are short-lived and quickly forgotten. This is part of the involutnary, constitutive task of the narrative layer of consciousness: to document and understand &lt;em&gt;who I am&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence each object is a vortex of purpose, relation, context, story, and memory. This is what we call “meaning.” An object has meaning when we can understand it in terms of all these things, and weave it into a coherent and intelligible narrative about ourselves and our character and history. That is what makes a symbol or a word meaningful — its relation to an intersubjective ability to communicate a concept and its relation to real things in the world — and it is what makes a person, object, or experience meaningful too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only time where there is a complete absence of meaning in the human experience is when there is no meaning to be had: no knowledge of context or purpose or history. Upon encountering a foreign object, there is a wrenching sense of unfamiliarity, as we for the first time encounter an object in the world &lt;em&gt;as it is&lt;/em&gt;, without the mediating buffer of context. This is also the experience one can have when looking at images intended to simulate the experience of stroke victims, where everything seems real and familiar, but nothing &lt;em&gt;makes sense&lt;/em&gt;. It has all lost its meaning. Some can train their minds to produce this effect at will, by changing their desires to those of seeing things devoid of context (this works because all awareness is mediated by desire), but this is not the default state of humanity, or even of the individuals capable of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meaning isn’t just a component of the human experience, however. It is a desired component. There is a term in the egoistic layer of consciousness’s reward function which motivates us to run the narrative layer of consciousness, with its attendant commitment to assigning meaning to everything, at all. Why is this, besides the necessity to do this for perceptual reasons? It is because, without meaning — without understanding relation and context and history and desire — action is ineffective, dangerous, and impossible, and therefore achieving desire becomes more difficult as well. Seeing meaning in objects in the world is a necessary condition for effectively achieving any desire at all, and therefore it itself is desired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This becomes all the more apparent when we switch our focus from individual objects to relations between objects or temporal events. In these, a new component of meaning can be found: pattern. Pattern is found in the likeness between multiple objects, which forms the basis for abstraction and therefore ontological induction — the application of previous knowledge of objects to future similar objects — or in the likeness between multiple temporal occurrences, forming the basis for temporal induction, leading to natural laws and cause and effect. These kinds of meaning, existing in the relations between objects, are even more crucial to action and therefore the satisfaction of desire, and thus the desire to finding patterns in things is even stronger for the human being. So strong, in fact, that we often find ourselves finding patterns in things where there are, in fact, no patterns at all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the crucial components of human consciousness is its ability to become an object of its own subjectivity, to turn the apparatus of perceptual awareness on itself and inspect its own Being. What does that look like, when the perceptual apparatus is richly imbued with meaning gleaned from the conscious subject itself? Well, when we turn this richly meaning-infused apparatus on itself, we are naturally led to ask questions concerning our relationship to something, our context, our relation to the satisfaction of some set of desires, our purpose according to something. This is what we are referring to when we say “what is the meaning of life (for me)?” The natural “something” that those relations and desires and purposes should be set relative to is of course ourself, as is the case when we look at external objects; after all, that is how the process of narrative-layer meaning-imbuing works in all other cases: it asks “what is the relation of this object to &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, what is its purpose to &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, how does it help or hinder &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; goals?” Yet, because we are &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to looking at an object’s meaning with respect to something external to the object — because when we look at external objects, their meaning comes from us, an object ourselves external to that object — when we look at ourselves as an object, we can sometimes make the mistake of looking for our relation to &lt;em&gt;something else&lt;/em&gt;, our purpose &lt;em&gt;to something else&lt;/em&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the natural problem becomes — what something else is to provide this externally-sourced meaning to ourselves viewed as objects? This can become family, friends, communities, or causes, but as often as not it is deities or dictators. After all, that something else was supposed to be ourselves, a conscious personal agent, so the most natural something else to fill that role, if we are looking outside ourselves, is another conscious personal agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is a misapplication of the meaning-imbuing process, which was built to, and when correctly applied only does, consider things in relation to ourselves. Thus, from a perceptual standpoint this looking for meaning ourside ourselves is a mistake, a bug in our source code. Not only that, but it is harmful, too. If we seek for meaning ourside ourselves and our own existences, we subbordinate our own narrative about ourselves and our character, our own choice about who we will be, what we think, and how to act, to the greater narrative of something other than ourselves, and this process causes us, over time, to lose our unique and individual identity, our ability to stand on our own outside of that external, stifling narrative and choose our own meaning and morality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what causes nihlism, what eats away at the core of humanity, the weakness that religion preys on and breeds: the increase of this mistake, this fluke in our perceptual system, that makes us seek meaning outside ourselves and depend on another, on something else, which can come to supplant our identities, our strengths, our individuality and autonomy. This is why you see Christians spout the idea that without Jesus, they are nothing, and their whole lives are defined in terms of Jesus, the Cross, the Church: their identities have rotten away, if they ever grew to begin with, under the smothering hand of their Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the question of the meaning of life arises, and because of a common (and encouraged) error, it causes suffering, subordination, and destruction of the self. I will explore this in more detail later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;37-action-and-will-free-and-otherwise&quot;&gt;3.7. Action and Will (“Free” and Otherwise)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I have been enumerating facts about the human condition which are primarily focused on its perceptual and experiential aspects. These are important, but they are not the whole story. As important as consciousness and experience are to human existence, action is equally necessary, if temporally and logically subordinate. Action is a necessary condition for human Being, just as perception is a necessary condition for both human Being and human action itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human action is the conscious application of means (elements of the environment and one’s own body and time) towards desired ends (states of the world or the self) according to some plan (constructed in the narrative consciousness of the human being).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human action is necessarily temporal on all levels, in the same way desire is. One acts because one desires to achieve some end in the future, because it is not now already achieved. Likewise, the process of constructing a plan, &lt;em&gt;choosing&lt;/em&gt; to act and what action to take, is also a temporal affair. There is a time in the consciousness when one does not know what action one will choose, and so, epistemologically, any action that seriously occurs to one at that moment seems equally likely — or at least, roughly so, even if, in actuality, a single choice is predetermined by all the factors involved. One must then go through a process of reasoning and choice in order to uncover which choice one is to make. This is why I phrase the process of choosing as a process of “uncovering”: the choice is already guaranteed, by the nature of your mind, your knowledge, and your environment, but it has not yet been arrived at, in the same way that the final motion of a Rube Goldberg machine is ensured and predetermined by the construction of the machine once it is set in motion, but it is not actually arrived at, known (except perhaps by the designer), or completed until the machine has actually gone through the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, human beings, in order to choose a plan of action, must represent choices to themselves as serious options which they &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; choose, in order to go through  the process of weighing the options and choosing one — even if this is done irrationally and in a split-second, and even if this is merely an epistemological fiction. Otherwise, the choice would already have to be made. In this way, we must phenomenologically and epistemologically ignore determinism in order to make choices at all. This is where people get the misconception of “free will” from: they think that because each option, before a choice is made, appears &lt;em&gt;epistemologically&lt;/em&gt; equally likely, because of a lack of information, they are actually &lt;em&gt;probabilistically&lt;/em&gt; equally likely, such that any one of them could &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; have been selected given the entire history of the world, and if time were rewound and the choice run again, a different choice could have been made. This is a classic confusion between Bayesian probability and frequentist probability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I state so confidently that free will does not exist, that all our choices are determined, because the concept of free will is inherently incoherent — a signifier that signifies no meaningful and distinct concept. Indeterminate effect (random chance) and determined effect are mutually exhaustive and mutually exclusive: an outcome is &lt;em&gt;either&lt;/em&gt; specified by the history of the world up until that point (determined), &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; there are possible worlds in which the history of the world was identical and yet the outcome was different, and therefore the history of the world does not specify the outcome (indeterminate). Libertarian free will is obviously incompatible with the first option, and neither is it compatible with the second. A choice is not “free” if it is fully determined by the past, but neither is it “free” if it is merely made on the basis of a causeless, perfectly random set of metaphysical dice, because in the sense of “free” that proponents of libertarian free will seem to mean, a free choice must be both determined in some crucial way by the character, history, and environment of the agent, and yet not fully determined by these factors, and yet not random either, but &lt;em&gt;volitional&lt;/em&gt;, whatever that means. They want to take incompatible, contradictory aspects from the two actual options in an attempt to sew them together into a Frankenstein’s monster of a third option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, and I reiterate this point because it is crucial, the fact that the choice one will make is predetermined from the outset does not negate either the true appearance of free will when making choices — and the vertiginous sense of freedom therein — nor the fact that one actually must go through a process of reasoning to discover what that foregone choice actually is. When a waiter asks you what you would like for dinner, you don’t say “let’s wait and see.” Moreover, because this choice is &lt;em&gt;in fact&lt;/em&gt; determined, even if it does not appear so, that means it stems in equal parts from one’s character (mind, personality, learned traits, inherited traits, all that makes up the specific nature of a person and makes them valuable or not, good or not), what one knows, and the environment around one. Therefore, the process of choice is a process of uncovering, but also simultaneously constituting and concretizing, &lt;em&gt;who one is&lt;/em&gt; in that moment. Am I the sort of person who will do X? Or Y?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The narrative component of consciousness does not just weave the choice itself, and all that says about one’s character, into its tapestry, however. It weaves in the meta-choices and assumptions involved in the choice: beliefs about the permissibility of that action, and other similar actions in relevantly similar cases, abstracted out as reason and empathy demand; beliefs about what states of the world are more or less valuable and how those values weigh in comparison to the actions taken. None of this is avoidable, and to attempt to ignore it is, as Sartre called it, “bad faith.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how moral responsibility, inasmuch as it is at all coherent, can be compatible with determinism: when an actor takes an action, there is a &lt;em&gt;particular actor&lt;/em&gt; that did so, and hence a locus of causation where many millions of causes are woven into one particular outcome that is the unique producer of such an outcome and therefore the most important step in the causal chain from the environment to the action. No environmental or historical factor of an individual guarantees that any other individual would, when placed in the same position, have done the same thing. Therefore, it is the individual themself that makes the crucial difference, even if the environment and history of the actor plays a part. Just as we say that it is the spark that caused the explosion at the gas station, even though it needed all the gas to be there, because the spark is the unique element that made the difference between &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; gas station and all the other ones, so we can say that a particular individual caused the results of their actions because they are the unique and particular element that led to that result. And insofar as their actions &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; in fact guaranteed by their environment, such that no other individual could have helped but to act in the same way (say, through mind control or extreme coercive threats), then we should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; hold them responsible, because it was not that particular, instantiated, physical, real person that was the deciding factor after all, but the person or persons who guaranteed that they would act in that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, when an action is taken, there is a &lt;em&gt;particular actor&lt;/em&gt; that is affirming a set of propositions about what is valuable and what is permissible; no one else inherently subscribes to those thoughts because of that action except that particular actor, even if what that actor does is completely determined by their environment and history, and no innate qualities (which is not true anyway). Therefore, there is an identifiable person that has decided that such actions were permissible, along with the consequences to them and threat (or benefit) to the community that that entails. And if there were other actors that manipulated their history and environment knowingly, in order to produce that set of beliefs, then they held those beliefs about value and permissible actions as well, and are therefore on the hook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, not only are humans, when we act, responsible for uncovering what sort of persons we are through our choices and actions, and the assumed beliefs implied by them, we are responsible for our actions ourselves, as the unique loci of causation that generate them. We are what determines are choices, so if anything we are &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; responsible for our choices and actions, given determinism, than if given libertarian free will. After all, given determinism, our actions and choices are fully implied by who and what we are and where we are, they flow from the intimately sensed realities of our situation, and should feel (as they do, at least for me) natural and inevitable after we make them. While, on the other hand, given libertarian free will, our choices and actions are only partly determined by the intimately felt realities of our existence, and partly by something else that is nebulous and Other, and therefore would feel alien to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this first part of a three part series on my particular take on existentialist philosophy and normative philosophy — unified with egoism and eudaimonism —  I discussed several topics. First, I discussed the need for this kind of philosophy, and why it is one of the last forms of useful philosophy there are. Second, I discussed my methodology, as it exists in a sort of comparative dialogue between my own experiences and their correlations with outside manifestation, and the input and manifestation of the human beings around me. Third, I explained the seven basic facts of the human experience: the fact that humans are thrown into an existence that they have no say in, and that experience of this existence constitutes our existence and consciousness; that consciousness is split into two layers which it alternates between in a complex feedback loop process, the narrative and egoistic layers; that thought is a necessary corollary of perception for human beings thanks to the existence of the narrative layer of consciousness; that desire is the mediator of all experience and conceptualization of the world around us, and that there must be some base set of fixed desires; the fact that humans exist through time; the fact that humans desire meaning, to weave the things around them into a narrative that is whole and unified and sensical; and finally, the fact that humans must act to exist, and that this action implies a sense of free will that is a denial and negation of determinism, while also a sense of responsibility that is an affirmation of it, and the implied self-reflecting assumptions of such action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next essay, I will dive deeper into how all of these facts come into play in order to produce a core conflicts in the human experience which is the source of our existential suffering. In the essay after that, I will show how solving these core conflicts can bring happiness to even the worst of lives — although it is not in itself sufficient for complete happiness — and ensure more fruitful lives and compassionate and harmonious relationships with others, as well as attempt to sketch out just such a solution.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alexis</name></author><category term="existentialism-series" /><summary type="html">“Everything has been figured out, except how to live.” — Satre</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Synthesis Libertarianism: A Manifesto</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2021/10/09/synthesis.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Synthesis Libertarianism: A Manifesto" /><published>2021-10-09T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-10-09T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2021/10/09/synthesis</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2021/10/09/synthesis.html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-introduction&quot;&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been an invisible war for the heart and soul of the libertarian movement going on since the 1960s, and corruption is winning. The foundational values of libertarianism have been all but lost in the influx of alt-right and neo-reactionary people, and something must finally be done about it lest we lose  those values completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thin libertarianism was the naive dream of a tiny and struggling movement striving to grow at all costs, but what does it matter if the movement grows, if the movement dies and becomes something else in the process? We need to take back “right” libertarianism. The purpose of this manifesto, then, is to establish a core set of foundational values which libertarians must share to have a consistent basis for their libertarianism, values that, we will show, are fundamentally incompatible with neo-reactionaries and the alt-right. Libertarian beliefs can be arrived at from other foundations, but a libertarianism thus conceived will be fundamentally at war with itself at best, and insincere at worst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This manifesto will focus not on specific conclusions, but instead on the values of the movement, because to do otherwise would turn this into an exercise in gatekeeping and thought-control, rendering our project merely an exercise in cult-building not unlike Objectivism or Austro-Libertarianism and thereby giving birth to nothing new and useful. It should be noted, however, that this focus on values and their consistent application has very broad implications — this is not a thin libertarianism 2.0. We will focus here primarily on the social aspects of this broadening, but values are applicable in a broad variety of cases, so setting out a list of them may have implications outside both politics and social interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we are trying to rescue “right” libertarianism from its right-wing infiltrators, it might seem odd that we are, in the process, seeking to rename it. However, consider this: if the values that make “right” libertarianism unique are incompatible with the rest of the right-wing, is it truly valid to call it right wing? Moreover, since the values of “right” libertarianism actually most naturally lead it to embrace certain leftist social — and even economic — values, what better way to express that this libertarianism is a fusion of some economically right-wing ideas and some economically and socially left-wing ideas than to give it a name representative of such a synthesis?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following document, we will briefly outline what these values are that libertarians as a movement must hold, and why they lead both to a respect for stricter property rights and social leftism and egalitarianism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-the-values-of-libertarianism&quot;&gt;2. The Values of Libertarianism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most obvious “libertarian value” is, of course, liberty. This is made evident by the very etymology of the name of the movement. There are, however, many different conceptions of liberty: positive, negative, individual, collective, social, atomistic, and more; hence specifying the precise concept of liberty meant when the word is used is far more important than simply saying you value liberty. Almost every post-Enlightenment political philosophy, even the authoritarian ones, claims to bring liberty, by some definition or another, to the political organization and its members, and it is the precise definition that makes the difference between the different political philosophies. If Marxism, fascism, and libertarianism all claim to bring liberty,  liberty means very little by itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, what specific definition you give to liberty, and the focus that one places on it relative to other values, depends on deeper, more foundational values. So, as simple as it might seem to claim that liberty, or even individual liberty, is the core value of the libertarian movement, I think it is necessary to delve deeper into its foundations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, I will try to locate the deepest foundation of the libertarian value-set, and then build up from there, thus showing how the specific definition of liberty that libertarians use develops from that deeper foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;21-individual-self-determination&quot;&gt;2.1. Individual Self-Determination&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first value that libertarians must hold in order to have a secure foundation for other libertarian beliefs and values is that of individual self-determination: the necessity and desirability of individual human beings applying their own minds and situated knowledge to the particular conditions around them in order to solve problems and achieve goals. This value may be held both because it sustains and makes possible the flourishing of human beings, and because it is the best method of creating a dynamic, creative, and efficient society. A few quotes will serve to substantiate that this is a common libertarian belief:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Since men can think, feel, evaluate, and act only as individuals, it becomes vitally necessary for each man’s survival and prosperity that he be free to learn, choose, develop his faculties, and act upon his knowledge and values. This is the necessary path of human nature; to interfere with and cripple this process by using violence goes profoundly against what is necessary by man’s nature for his life and prosperity. Violent interference with a man’s learning and choices is therefore profoundly “antihuman”; it violates the natural law of man’s needs.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Since knowledge, thinking, and rational action are properties of the individual, since the choice to exercise his rational faculty or not depends on the individual, man’s survival requires that those who think be free of the interference of those who don’t. Since men are neither omniscient nor infallible, they must be free to agree or disagree, to cooperate or to pursue their own independent course, each according to his own rational judgment. Freedom is the fundamental requirement of man’s mind.” &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“He who lets the world, or his own portion of it, choose his plan of life for him, has no need of any other faculty than the ape-like one of imitation… he requires and exercises [uniquely human qualities] exactly in proportion as the part of his conduct which he determines according to his own judgment and feelings is a large one. It is possible that he might be guided in some good path, and kept out of harm’s way, without any of these [qualities]. But what will be his comparative worth as a human being? It really is of importance, not only what men do, but also what manner of men they are that do it. Among the works of man, which human life is rightly employed in perfecting and beautifying, the first in importance surely is man himself.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“If we can agree that the economic problem of society is mainly one of rapid adaptation to changes in the particular circumstances of time and place, it would seem to follow that the ultimate decisions must be left to the people who are familiar with these circumstances, who know directly of the relevant changes and of the resources immediately available to meet them. We cannot expect that this problem will be solved by first communicating all this knowledge to a central board which, after integrating all knowledge, issues its orders. We must solve it by some form of decentralization.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why must this value be held? Because all human beings value the welfare of themselves and, to a lesser degree, other human beings; furthermore, all human beings care about the wealth and health of their society, as this influences their ability to achieve what they desire. Therefore, if one were to believe that freedom to exercise one’s choices was unhealthy for human beings, not conducive to their flourishing, and deleterious to the health of society, then it would be impossible to consistently and enthusiastically support freedom. Moreover, it is the freedom to make one’s own choices that is characteristic of the specific liberty which libertarians endorse, as opposed to the freedom from want or worry or oppression or isolation or even exploitation which other theories of freedom and liberty value more highly. Of course, many of those things can individual self-determination, but it is also possible that the use of one’s reasoning can make oneself worried, wanting, exploited, or isolated, and if this is the product of one’s free choice, then it is a part of liberty and its corollary, responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;22-consistency-and-equality&quot;&gt;2.2. Consistency and Equality&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another value of primary importance in the libertarian project, one which is necessary to provide a firm foundation for all the beliefs characteristic of those who partake in the movement, is that of consistency or universalizability. A libertarian desires not just individual self-determination (from here on, simply “liberty”) for some individuals, but for all individuals equally. A libertarian also requires the same duties and responsibilities from everyone: everyone has an equal responsibility for the consequences of their own actions, both to themselves and others, and an equal duty to refrain from coercing others, short-circuiting their process of individual self-determination by a threat of violence or by the physical prevention of their choice of action. Libertarians should have, and desire, no gods, kings, or masters, and only accept authority insofar as it is bound by the same rules as everyone else. All human beings share the same essential moral properties: the capacity to use our own reasoning and knowledge, and the capacity to understand, follow, and knowingly violate moral principles. Libertarians recognize this, and realize that whatever reasoning can be given for the liberty of some humans, can be given for the liberty of all humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why the signature phrase of right libertarians, “taxation is theft,” exists — it is an application of the everyday moral standards and duties of the rest of humanity to the actions of the political class, and a judgement of what they do. This is also why social contract theory has been so important to the history of libertarianism, from Locke to Nozick: an account of how a state may be justified usually appeals to special powers, either granted by god or the collective, that allow some to act in ways that others may not; this is not satisfying to a libertarian, however, and so another account, an account that explains how the state could have arisen only from the common rights of man, must be found. Opinion concerning the success of such accounts is immaterial; the fact that such an account must be found if the state is to be justified in one’s mind is what is important to whether one is a libertarian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few quotes on this subject by various libertarians:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“‘Equality,’ in a human context, is a political term: it means equality before the law, the equality of fundamental, inalienable rights which every man possesses by virtue of his birth as a human being, and which may not be infringed or abrogated by man-made institutions, such as titles of nobility or the division of men into castes established by law, with special privileges granted to some and denied to others.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Equality of the general rules of law and conduct, however, is the only kind of equality conducive to liberty and the only equality which we can secure without destroying liberty. Not only has liberty nothing to do with any other sort of equality, but it is even bound to produce inequality in many respects.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Anarchists hold that morality must be upheld in all cases, and not abandoned whenever State actions are involved.  Men have long since rejected the Divine Right of Kings; surely it is now past time to do the same with all claims that the State is Extra-Human or Extra-Moral.  The State must be judged on the same level and by the same principles as all other human actions and institutions; one rule applies to all.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“If every person has the right to defend even by force — his person, his liberty, and his property, then it follows that a group of men have the right to organize and support a common force to protect these rights constantly… Thus, since an individual cannot lawfully use force against the person, liberty, or property of another individual, then the common force — for the same reason — cannot lawfully be used to destroy the person, liberty, or property of individuals or groups.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why, too, must this view be upheld if one is to be a consistent libertarian? This is perhaps a more complex answer, but it is nevertheless a very important one. The answer has three parts, the first of which I covered before the quotes, and I’ll cover the last two now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, because a system which grants liberty to some and not others simply does not resemble what anyone would call a libertarian system; one of the defining features of libertarianism is the fact that it applies the same logic to every single individual within a society, since it is an individualistic philosophy. A system which grants liberty to one class, but allows that class to limit the liberty of another class, is an aristocratic or otherwise authoritarian system, not a libertarian one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, if the goal is to maximize liberty, then it must be recognized that we must give each and every person the maximum amount of liberty possible, and an exercise of too great a liberty of one person lessens the liberty of another (if I steal from you, I gain the liberty to decide the fate of the object I steal, but you lose that liberty; indeed, you lose the further liberty of deciding what to do with the outcomes of your prior choices that are concretized in that item). Assigning a fully maximal amount of liberty to a few and a proportionally lesser amount to everyone else is not as viable an option, because the maximum amount of liberty one person is able to experience is not as great as the medium amount of liberty of several, and allowing anyone and everyone to violate the liberty of others is not going to solve the problem either, as generally the violation of liberty either simply transfers liberties from one person to another (thereby not increasing the total amount), or decreases the amount of freedom exercised overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which of these three rationales, or what combination of them, you find most important and convincing will depend on what your foundations for holding these values are, but the important point is that you must hold these values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;23-entitlement-theory-of-justice-in-holdings&quot;&gt;2.3. Entitlement Theory of Justice In Holdings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another distinguishing value of libertarianism as synthesis libertarianism seeks to encapsulate it is a certain, as Nozick termed it, entitlement theory of justice in holdings. In this view, any rights one has over something are determined by the historical story of that object: how it was originally produced or appropriated and how it was transferred. There are of course differing opinions on what exactly constitutes just original appropriation, what exactly constitutes just transfer, and what should happen should the full history of an object not be available or be tainted — as most land is — with historical injustice. But the fundamental value that libertarians all share is the view that justice is constituted in the nature of individual actions and intentions, not in the nature of outcomes, so to establish justice in holdings, as in all other things, one must look to the actions and intentions which generated that holding — the history of that holding. This is, in a sense, an outcome of the corollary of liberty I mentioned some time ago, responsibility, since the fundamental idea is that one has a just claim to a holding if it is the outcome of just actions on your part, and one has no such claim if it is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some further quotes to substantiate this as a libertarian view:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“[T]he right to property is a right to action, like all the others: it is not the right to an object, but to the action and the consequences of producing or earning that object. It is not a guarantee that a man will earn any property, but only a guarantee that he will own it if he earns it. It is the right to gain, to keep, to use and to dispose of material values.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:9&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:9&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“In contrast to end-result principles of justice, historical principles of justice hold that past circumstances or actions of people can create differential entitlements or differential deserts to things. An injustice can be worked by moving from one distribution to another structurally identical one, for the second, in profile the same, may violate people’s entitlements or deserts; it may not fit the actual history.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:10&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:10&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Therefore, we do not yet know which one of the two men is the legitimate or just property owner. We can only find the answer through investigating the concrete data of the particular case, i.e., through ‘historical’ inquiry. Thus, we cannot simply say that the great axiomatic moral rule of the libertarian society is the protection of property rights, period. For the criminal has no natural right whatever to the retention of prop­erty that he has stolen; the aggressor has no right to claim any property that he has acquired by aggression.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:11&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:11&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why must libertarians hold that private property, born out of the individual actions of people and determined in its justice by the justice of those originating actions, is a value that must be upheld? Again, first of all, it is simply a constituent property of what it means to be a libertarian in the sense that I have been using and in the sense that synthesis libertarianism is attempting to preserve; but secondly, it is because it is a necessary extension of the other principles so far. It is a construction of property which is based on the outcomes of individual actions within liberty, is equally applicable in its principles and rules to all people, and is necessary for people to preserve their own lives by their own hands and minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;24-proportionality&quot;&gt;2.4. Proportionality&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another component of libertarian value which is of primary importance is that of proportionality in justice. Although phrased barbarically, the old saying “an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth” really does sum up the libertarian approach to justice. A violation of someone’s liberty or property is to be met with a proportional, appropriate response, a violation in equal magnitude used either to prevent the violation from being consummated, or to produce restitution for a completed violation. This is what differentiates libertarians from other political philosophies in many ways: for instance, some progressives will advocate the use of the state — which operates on the basis of the threat of violence and kidnapping — to deal with violations of others that are not nearly so severe, even if they are undesirable: for instance, collusion to prevent someone from getting a job, or discrimination, or hate speech. These are undesirable things that actually violate the values I have previously outlined, but they are either the results of inaction on the part of the parties directly involved, or action that does not rise to the level of physical violence, and therefore to meet them with physical violence or the threat of it is a grossly disproportionate act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthemore, as part of making sense of this, it must be seen that the basis of whether something is a punishable crime is in the specific action that has been committed, and the extent to which it can be punished is in the specific action as well, as the punishment itself must be proportional to the action. Therefore, if no person or group was identifiably harmed, then harm cannot be done to a particular person or group in retaliation to that action in a proportional manner, because the action itself caused no harm to any particular person or group!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why even those libertarians who view the state as legitimate tend to view it as a necessary evil, or an institution which should be limited to making laws against crimes which are proportional to the severity of the powers which it leverages to enforce its laws. This is also why libertarians, although they are interested in historical justice, are opposed to collective punishment based on ancestry or group membership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few quotes will substantiate this point:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[quote on how it is wrong to use the law to enforce against things that are not themselves violent]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I propose another fundamental rule regard­ing crime: the criminal, or invader, loses his own right to the extent that he has deprived another man of his. If a man deprives another man of some of his self-ownership or its extension in physical property, to that extent does he lose his own rights. From this principle immediately derives the proportionality theory of punishment-best summed up in the old adage: ‘let the punishment fit the crime.’”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:12&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:12&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why must this value be held by libertarians? Simply because, if it were to be held that any violation of liberty could be punished equally, then the subtle gaslighting and indoctrination of a religious group, or the oppressive but non-violent ostracism of a community committed to a particular tradition, could be punished with the same severity, if deemed necessary, as a terrorist attack or a school shooting. Likewise, the failure to give enough to charity, or hire someone for a job, or competition with someone for a job and beating them to be hired, might be offenses punishable by law, because although they are not violent actions, without a theory of proportionality, we would not be able to choose which things are rightly punishable by law and which are not outside of whether we like them or not. Hence without a theory of proportionality, it is very easy to go down a very authoritarian and restrictive route that is inherently antithetical to libertarianism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;25-the-initiation-response-distinction&quot;&gt;2.5. The Initiation-Response Distinction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the final, and perhaps most recognizable, libertarian value, although I have couched it in new terms for philosophical clarity. The fundamental distinction here is best elaborated by the idea of the Non-Aggression Principle: the idea that violence can only be justified when used in retaliation, for the purposes of defense or restitution, and is justified by the very fact that violence was initiated, or used, prior. In essence, it points out the fundamental and seemingly self-evident, yet surprisingly oft-missed, moral distinction between the initiation of violence against someone who has done nothing violent, and responding with violence to someone else who has used violence against you. It is possible to be a pacifist and condemn both these things, but there are morally relevant distinctions between them, so that to condemn both, either you would need to broaden your reasoning from what is commonly used, or use different reasoning for the condemnation of each type. Libertarians specifically value these two things differently: the initiation of a violation of someone’s liberty is morally reprehensible, while retaliation against it is at the very least morally neutral, and sometimes even morally praiseworthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This view bleeds into many other libertarian views: views on when war is just (only in defense), when violence is just on a personal level (in self-defense or defense of others) and what the law can be used for (in response to actions, never prior to actions, further modified by considerations of proportionality).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some quotes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Men have the right to use physical force only in retaliation and only against those who initiate its use. The ethical principle involved is simple and clear-cut: it is the difference between murder and self-defense. A holdup man seeks to gain a value, wealth, by killing his victim; the victim does not grow richer by killing a holdup man. The principle is: no man may obtain any values from others by resorting to physical force.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:13&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:13&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“No one may threaten or commit violence (‘aggress’) against another man’s person or property. Violence may be employed only against the man who commits such violence; that is, only defensively against the aggressive violence of another. In short, no violence may be employed against a nonaggressor. Here is the fundamental rule from which can be deduced the entire corpus of libertarian theory.”[14]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This value is, in its essence, an extension of the principle of proportionality outlined above, in the sense that any action in retaliation to no action, or any violent action in retaliation to a non-violent one, is automatically and obviously unacceptable to a libertarian-minded person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-social-leftism&quot;&gt;3. Social Leftism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far what we have stated should not be controversial: we have attempted to identify the values common to libertarians, and as such these values are generally agreed-upon in the community. Now, however, we must proceed to the true purpose of this manifesto: an analysis of how a consistent application of these values to more than merely politics and law — as would make sense for anyone who actually held these values, as values cannot be held only in certain cases and not others — leads to non-traditional, and leftist, social views. Let us examine why this is the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;31-anti-traditionalism-and-moderate-pluralism&quot;&gt;3.1. Anti-Traditionalism and Moderate Pluralism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following on from individual self-determination, many of the reasons that support a distrust or dislike of state intervention also support a distrust or dislike of social norms and traditions. If the state should not intervene in economic matters because each person is in a generally superior position to know what is best for them and those around them in comparison to a central authority, and central authorities are unable to adapt to change, then it follows that “society” (as a centralized institution of majority enforcement and tradition) does not know what is best for everyone when it comes to lifestyle either. It would be strange to argue that although a centralized authority is not competent to know what the best job or allocation of resources is for everyone, it would be competent to know what the best family structure or lifestyle is for everyone. Likewise, if in economic decisions it is best for human flourishing to allow human beings to make their own choices, using their reason and values and integrity, then how can it be otherwise in the case of social decisions, which are arguably more important to a person’s happiness in many cases?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus we must say that tradition is to be viewed as a toolbox or selection of premade molds, which are to be chosen and evaluated by the reason of each individual in each individual case, and social enforcement of norms or normality is merely another form of illegitimate and stifling authority that is of very little use in most cases[15]. This must be extended to gender, sexuality, family structure, and every other corner of social life: every part of it must be subject to the reason of the individual, to be adapted to their unique situation and set of values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This implication is one even Rothbard himself seems to have grasped to some degree, although his social views did not fully encompass the implications here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Meyer begins with the complaint that libertarians are really ‘libertines’… because we ‘reject’ the ‘reality’ of five thousand years of Western civilization, and propose to substitute an abstract construction.  Very true; in other words, we, like Lord Acton, propose to weigh the growth of encrusted tradition and institutions in the light of man’s natural reason, and of course we find these often despotic institutions wanting.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:16&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:16&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must also recognize — in what I call “moderate pluralism” — that while some things are universally good for human life and flourishing (such as liberty), there is a wide range within the limits set by those constants within which the proper values of humans can fall, so that what is right for the flourishing of one person may not be right for the flourishing of another. Therefore, although it is possible to say that some lifestyles are wrong, it is not possible to say that one, or even several, lifestyles are solely right. This is an extension of the economic idea that there are many values that human beings could pursue (within certain limits), and that to attempt to discover which set of values is right for each individual in order to enforce it is a foolhardy task, but that if it were possible to do so, then freedom would be unnecessary and perhaps even undesirable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence libertarians must not simply tolerate those who pursue different lifestyles, while doggedly sticking to traditions, but must instead value in themselves pluralism and non-traditionalism, attempting to strike out and discover what is best for their individual case while praising and valuing the social entrepreneurship of others who try still other lifestyles. Thus it is impossible to truly be a conservative — one who thinks that following tradition is the best thing to do for all people, and does so themselves, and finds others who do things they don’t do disgusting or degenerate — while holding libertarian values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;32-anti-authoritarianism&quot;&gt;3.2. Anti-Authoritarianism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Libertarians are generally defined, on the two-dimensional political compass, at least, as in opposition to authoritarians by default; as such, it might seem redundant and even comical to list this as a value that is not often shared by right libertarians nowadays and must be specified. However, I think that, like the other values, the dislike for authoritarianism which libertarians express concerning the state is not often applied elsewhere, both in the social and the economic world. Many libertarians decry the authoritarianism and paternalism of the state, but see no problem with priests, pastors, and patriarchs telling people what to do down to the smallest minutiae, or with bosses and CEOs who are so far removed from the process of production as to be completely ignorant of it making choices for workers all day long, ensuring that those workers become little more than mindless machines or trained animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this juncture, many libertarians will recoil with horror at our lambasting of these social and economic phenomena, retorting that these things are not (usually) born of coercion and violence and therefore libertarianism may have nothing to say concerning them. That is not so! The idea that, simply because a value cannot be enforced by law, it is outside the scope of valuation in political philosophy is a fallacy born of the too-long-extended existence of an invasive state; there are many other ways of pursuing and enforcing a value than mere violence, ways that both libertarians and authoritarians have forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A true libertarian at heart, one which shares the values I have listed above, will not enjoy seeing the subjugation, even if voluntary and convenient, of one human being to another, the surrender of their will and reason to them, and the enforcement of this through any means whatsoever. Sometimes it is necessary or convenient, but it is never something one should seek or enjoy seeing. It is always, like some libertarians view the state to be, a necessary evil at best, and an unnecessary atrocity at worst. An overbearing father, pastor, priest, or patriarch can be as damaging to the flourishing of someone, and the operation and adaptation of the social community, as any government law, sometimes moreso; likewise, a surfeit of centralization in the economic world (whether through hierarchies of authority or through democratic means), or an overgrowth of corporatism and command-thinking, can be just as damaging to an economy as state intervention, although the latter is what usually leads to the former existing in damaging amounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, seeing all human beings as fundamentally morally equal, a libertarian must view any subordination or authority as a contingent and emergent phenomena, one which is not fundamental to the relation of one human being to another; thus the default, the null hypothesis if you will, is that there is no authority whatsoever, and any authority which wishes to establish itself must explain and justify its existence before a libertarian will bow to it. As Locke says, “there [is] nothing more evident, than that creatures of the same species and rank, promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature, and the use of the same faculties, should also be equal one amongst another without subordination or subjection…”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:17&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:17&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The process of seeking such a justification for the state, as I have said previously, is seen in the social contract tradition. As Noam Chomsky, a noted anarchist but not libertarian, has said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Hierarchic and authoritarian structures are not self-justifying. They have to have a justification. So if there is a relation of subordination and domination, maybe you can justify it, but there’s a strong burden of proof on anybody who tries to justify it. Quite commonly, the justification can’t be given. It’s a relationship that is maintained by obedience, by force, by tradition, by one or another form of sometimes physical, sometimes intellectual or moral coercion. If so, it ought to be dismantled. People ought to become liberated and discover that they are under a form of oppression which is illegitimate, and move to dismantle it.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:18&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:18&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;33-social-justice&quot;&gt;3.3. Social Justice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that libertarians value justice in the current distribution of holdings, and view it as an outcome and consequence of the justice of the individual actions that led to that distribution, lends itself naturally to a concern for historical injustice. While a conservative may say that some historical injustice is not relevant to the present, because it took place in the past and was performed by no person alive today, as they are more concerned with protecting the actual holdings and distributions of the status quo, libertarians who find that historical injustice has taken part in the production of the current situation, being committed to the protection of the moral right to property and not the positive right, must view this as immediately relevant to current events and what actions they should take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say, necessarily, that libertarians must be in favor of reparations. After all, although most libertarian theories of property rights are very similar, the specific details of how they are justified and worked out can have large effects on what should be done about holdings that have an illegitimate or unjust history. Furthermore, there are many morally relevant differences between different cases; Rothbard’s theory of property and criminality, for instance, in dealing only with present cases of theft, has six distinct cases in which the proper action is entirely different. (As far as I know, too, very few libertarian theories of property rights have very much at all to say about inheritance not based on explicit contract, which makes dealing with historical injustices more difficult). Importantly, in addition, libertarians are primarily concerned with individuals. Therefore, the collective punishment aspect of reparations, which is often done on the basis of racial groups, is immediately at least suspect and to most libertarians, off the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the historical process by which current holdings are arrived at, and current states assign their positive property rights, should be of interest to libertarians, and they should seriously consider the implications of the fact that much property, especially in land, was originally claimed by conquest and genocide. It cannot be so easily dismissed, as Mises did in Human Action, by simply pointing out that most property is not held in a direct line of inheritance now that a market system is in place, either&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:19&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:19&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; although this is a relevant factor, and perhaps indicates how a solution can be found and why those who own land now should not themselves be viewed as violent expropriators, it is not necessarily the last word on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-conclusion&quot;&gt;5. Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope to have shown, in this short manifesto, that to hold the values that provide a solid and consistent foundation for libertarianism consistently, social views that are fundamentally at odds with conservatism and reactionary thinking must be adopted as well. It is only possible to be a personally conservative libertarian to the extent that it is possible to tolerate cognitive dissonance, holding one set of values when force is involved, and one set of values when it is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commonly accepted fiction in the libertarian community of “thin libertarianism” is an impossible illusion. It is impossible because it puts forward the idea that as long as one holds certain beliefs, it does not matter what values undergird those beliefs, nor, if those beliefs are based on libertarian values, whether those libertarian values are held consistently. But those who do not share libertarian values can at best have a fleeting, insincere, and contingent libertarianism, and are murderous bedfellows indeed, and those who do not hold libertarian values consistently are open to cracks in their foundation of such a significant nature that it is a wonder that their beliefs do not crumble at a touch; moreover, those who profess to hold inconsistent values are prone to selecting one value set over another, and only pretending to maintain the other set, thereby often converting into the first type of insincere libertarian. Thin libertarianism was the dream of a strategy to radically grow a tiny and struggling movement, but it has ultimately failed, because it has led us to allow into our inner sanctums and philosophical cannon those who fundamentally do not care about the things we care about, do not value the things we value, and refuse to apply the values that they do share with us consistently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have welcomed fascists into our ranks because they were willing to support property rights, we have welcomed religious reactionaries into our ranks because they were willing to support property rights, we have sold our souls for property rights — only to find out that the people we allied ourselves with don’t value liberty, don’t value property, they merely want to be free from the government because the government doesn’t do what they like, and as soon as the government does do what they like, or as soon as they can achieve power by some other means, they will do all they can to destroy what we value. Worse, they have corrupted and weakened our philosophical foundations, furthering the fiction that any value set can arrive at consistent and hearty libertarianism. This is a falsehood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Libertarianism must reclaim its soul, by recognizing its values and applying them consistently, and in doing so it must transition from merely a statement about when violence can be used, to a statement about what we value, what is good, what is desirable. We must realize that simply not condoning coercion and violence is not enough, that we cannot sit back and claim the moral high ground merely because we are not murderers and theives, and cannot expect anyone to want to be around us simply because we have done the &lt;em&gt;bare minimum&lt;/em&gt;. There is more that a libertarian community must value and work towards. This will change what libertarianism is, fuse it with leftism and even a little socialism, but that is not something to lament or view as a necessary evil — those parts of these views which we synthesize into our position are merely the natural extension of what we already value, and so we should welcome a synthesis libertarianism with open arms, for it is a full embrace of what we already love so dearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Alexis</name></author><summary type="html">1. Introduction There has been an invisible war for the heart and soul of the libertarian movement going on since the 1960s, and corruption is winning. The foundational values of libertarianism have been all but lost in the influx of alt-right and neo-reactionary people, and something must finally be done about it lest we lose those values completely. Thin libertarianism was the naive dream of a tiny and struggling movement striving to grow at all costs, but what does it matter if the movement grows, if the movement dies and becomes something else in the process? We need to take back “right” libertarianism. The purpose of this manifesto, then, is to establish a core set of foundational values which libertarians must share to have a consistent basis for their libertarianism, values that, we will show, are fundamentally incompatible with neo-reactionaries and the alt-right. Libertarian beliefs can be arrived at from other foundations, but a libertarianism thus conceived will be fundamentally at war with itself at best, and insincere at worst. This manifesto will focus not on specific conclusions, but instead on the values of the movement, because to do otherwise would turn this into an exercise in gatekeeping and thought-control, rendering our project merely an exercise in cult-building not unlike Objectivism or Austro-Libertarianism and thereby giving birth to nothing new and useful. It should be noted, however, that this focus on values and their consistent application has very broad implications — this is not a thin libertarianism 2.0. We will focus here primarily on the social aspects of this broadening, but values are applicable in a broad variety of cases, so setting out a list of them may have implications outside both politics and social interaction. If we are trying to rescue “right” libertarianism from its right-wing infiltrators, it might seem odd that we are, in the process, seeking to rename it. However, consider this: if the values that make “right” libertarianism unique are incompatible with the rest of the right-wing, is it truly valid to call it right wing? Moreover, since the values of “right” libertarianism actually most naturally lead it to embrace certain leftist social — and even economic — values, what better way to express that this libertarianism is a fusion of some economically right-wing ideas and some economically and socially left-wing ideas than to give it a name representative of such a synthesis? In the following document, we will briefly outline what these values are that libertarians as a movement must hold, and why they lead both to a respect for stricter property rights and social leftism and egalitarianism. 2. The Values of Libertarianism The most obvious “libertarian value” is, of course, liberty. This is made evident by the very etymology of the name of the movement. There are, however, many different conceptions of liberty: positive, negative, individual, collective, social, atomistic, and more; hence specifying the precise concept of liberty meant when the word is used is far more important than simply saying you value liberty. Almost every post-Enlightenment political philosophy, even the authoritarian ones, claims to bring liberty, by some definition or another, to the political organization and its members, and it is the precise definition that makes the difference between the different political philosophies. If Marxism, fascism, and libertarianism all claim to bring liberty, liberty means very little by itself. Furthermore, what specific definition you give to liberty, and the focus that one places on it relative to other values, depends on deeper, more foundational values. So, as simple as it might seem to claim that liberty, or even individual liberty, is the core value of the libertarian movement, I think it is necessary to delve deeper into its foundations. With this in mind, I will try to locate the deepest foundation of the libertarian value-set, and then build up from there, thus showing how the specific definition of liberty that libertarians use develops from that deeper foundation. 2.1. Individual Self-Determination The first value that libertarians must hold in order to have a secure foundation for other libertarian beliefs and values is that of individual self-determination: the necessity and desirability of individual human beings applying their own minds and situated knowledge to the particular conditions around them in order to solve problems and achieve goals. This value may be held both because it sustains and makes possible the flourishing of human beings, and because it is the best method of creating a dynamic, creative, and efficient society. A few quotes will serve to substantiate that this is a common libertarian belief: “Since men can think, feel, evaluate, and act only as individuals, it becomes vitally necessary for each man’s survival and prosperity that he be free to learn, choose, develop his faculties, and act upon his knowledge and values. This is the necessary path of human nature; to interfere with and cripple this process by using violence goes profoundly against what is necessary by man’s nature for his life and prosperity. Violent interference with a man’s learning and choices is therefore profoundly “antihuman”; it violates the natural law of man’s needs.”1 “Since knowledge, thinking, and rational action are properties of the individual, since the choice to exercise his rational faculty or not depends on the individual, man’s survival requires that those who think be free of the interference of those who don’t. Since men are neither omniscient nor infallible, they must be free to agree or disagree, to cooperate or to pursue their own independent course, each according to his own rational judgment. Freedom is the fundamental requirement of man’s mind.” 2 “He who lets the world, or his own portion of it, choose his plan of life for him, has no need of any other faculty than the ape-like one of imitation… he requires and exercises [uniquely human qualities] exactly in proportion as the part of his conduct which he determines according to his own judgment and feelings is a large one. It is possible that he might be guided in some good path, and kept out of harm’s way, without any of these [qualities]. But what will be his comparative worth as a human being? It really is of importance, not only what men do, but also what manner of men they are that do it. Among the works of man, which human life is rightly employed in perfecting and beautifying, the first in importance surely is man himself.”3 “If we can agree that the economic problem of society is mainly one of rapid adaptation to changes in the particular circumstances of time and place, it would seem to follow that the ultimate decisions must be left to the people who are familiar with these circumstances, who know directly of the relevant changes and of the resources immediately available to meet them. We cannot expect that this problem will be solved by first communicating all this knowledge to a central board which, after integrating all knowledge, issues its orders. We must solve it by some form of decentralization.”4 Why must this value be held? Because all human beings value the welfare of themselves and, to a lesser degree, other human beings; furthermore, all human beings care about the wealth and health of their society, as this influences their ability to achieve what they desire. Therefore, if one were to believe that freedom to exercise one’s choices was unhealthy for human beings, not conducive to their flourishing, and deleterious to the health of society, then it would be impossible to consistently and enthusiastically support freedom. Moreover, it is the freedom to make one’s own choices that is characteristic of the specific liberty which libertarians endorse, as opposed to the freedom from want or worry or oppression or isolation or even exploitation which other theories of freedom and liberty value more highly. Of course, many of those things can individual self-determination, but it is also possible that the use of one’s reasoning can make oneself worried, wanting, exploited, or isolated, and if this is the product of one’s free choice, then it is a part of liberty and its corollary, responsibility. 2.2. Consistency and Equality Another value of primary importance in the libertarian project, one which is necessary to provide a firm foundation for all the beliefs characteristic of those who partake in the movement, is that of consistency or universalizability. A libertarian desires not just individual self-determination (from here on, simply “liberty”) for some individuals, but for all individuals equally. A libertarian also requires the same duties and responsibilities from everyone: everyone has an equal responsibility for the consequences of their own actions, both to themselves and others, and an equal duty to refrain from coercing others, short-circuiting their process of individual self-determination by a threat of violence or by the physical prevention of their choice of action. Libertarians should have, and desire, no gods, kings, or masters, and only accept authority insofar as it is bound by the same rules as everyone else. All human beings share the same essential moral properties: the capacity to use our own reasoning and knowledge, and the capacity to understand, follow, and knowingly violate moral principles. Libertarians recognize this, and realize that whatever reasoning can be given for the liberty of some humans, can be given for the liberty of all humans. This is why the signature phrase of right libertarians, “taxation is theft,” exists — it is an application of the everyday moral standards and duties of the rest of humanity to the actions of the political class, and a judgement of what they do. This is also why social contract theory has been so important to the history of libertarianism, from Locke to Nozick: an account of how a state may be justified usually appeals to special powers, either granted by god or the collective, that allow some to act in ways that others may not; this is not satisfying to a libertarian, however, and so another account, an account that explains how the state could have arisen only from the common rights of man, must be found. Opinion concerning the success of such accounts is immaterial; the fact that such an account must be found if the state is to be justified in one’s mind is what is important to whether one is a libertarian. Here are a few quotes on this subject by various libertarians: “‘Equality,’ in a human context, is a political term: it means equality before the law, the equality of fundamental, inalienable rights which every man possesses by virtue of his birth as a human being, and which may not be infringed or abrogated by man-made institutions, such as titles of nobility or the division of men into castes established by law, with special privileges granted to some and denied to others.”5 “Equality of the general rules of law and conduct, however, is the only kind of equality conducive to liberty and the only equality which we can secure without destroying liberty. Not only has liberty nothing to do with any other sort of equality, but it is even bound to produce inequality in many respects.”6 “Anarchists hold that morality must be upheld in all cases, and not abandoned whenever State actions are involved. Men have long since rejected the Divine Right of Kings; surely it is now past time to do the same with all claims that the State is Extra-Human or Extra-Moral. The State must be judged on the same level and by the same principles as all other human actions and institutions; one rule applies to all.”7 “If every person has the right to defend even by force — his person, his liberty, and his property, then it follows that a group of men have the right to organize and support a common force to protect these rights constantly… Thus, since an individual cannot lawfully use force against the person, liberty, or property of another individual, then the common force — for the same reason — cannot lawfully be used to destroy the person, liberty, or property of individuals or groups.”8 Why, too, must this view be upheld if one is to be a consistent libertarian? This is perhaps a more complex answer, but it is nevertheless a very important one. The answer has three parts, the first of which I covered before the quotes, and I’ll cover the last two now. First, because a system which grants liberty to some and not others simply does not resemble what anyone would call a libertarian system; one of the defining features of libertarianism is the fact that it applies the same logic to every single individual within a society, since it is an individualistic philosophy. A system which grants liberty to one class, but allows that class to limit the liberty of another class, is an aristocratic or otherwise authoritarian system, not a libertarian one. Second, if the goal is to maximize liberty, then it must be recognized that we must give each and every person the maximum amount of liberty possible, and an exercise of too great a liberty of one person lessens the liberty of another (if I steal from you, I gain the liberty to decide the fate of the object I steal, but you lose that liberty; indeed, you lose the further liberty of deciding what to do with the outcomes of your prior choices that are concretized in that item). Assigning a fully maximal amount of liberty to a few and a proportionally lesser amount to everyone else is not as viable an option, because the maximum amount of liberty one person is able to experience is not as great as the medium amount of liberty of several, and allowing anyone and everyone to violate the liberty of others is not going to solve the problem either, as generally the violation of liberty either simply transfers liberties from one person to another (thereby not increasing the total amount), or decreases the amount of freedom exercised overall. Which of these three rationales, or what combination of them, you find most important and convincing will depend on what your foundations for holding these values are, but the important point is that you must hold these values. 2.3. Entitlement Theory of Justice In Holdings Another distinguishing value of libertarianism as synthesis libertarianism seeks to encapsulate it is a certain, as Nozick termed it, entitlement theory of justice in holdings. In this view, any rights one has over something are determined by the historical story of that object: how it was originally produced or appropriated and how it was transferred. There are of course differing opinions on what exactly constitutes just original appropriation, what exactly constitutes just transfer, and what should happen should the full history of an object not be available or be tainted — as most land is — with historical injustice. But the fundamental value that libertarians all share is the view that justice is constituted in the nature of individual actions and intentions, not in the nature of outcomes, so to establish justice in holdings, as in all other things, one must look to the actions and intentions which generated that holding — the history of that holding. This is, in a sense, an outcome of the corollary of liberty I mentioned some time ago, responsibility, since the fundamental idea is that one has a just claim to a holding if it is the outcome of just actions on your part, and one has no such claim if it is not. Here are some further quotes to substantiate this as a libertarian view: “[T]he right to property is a right to action, like all the others: it is not the right to an object, but to the action and the consequences of producing or earning that object. It is not a guarantee that a man will earn any property, but only a guarantee that he will own it if he earns it. It is the right to gain, to keep, to use and to dispose of material values.”9 “In contrast to end-result principles of justice, historical principles of justice hold that past circumstances or actions of people can create differential entitlements or differential deserts to things. An injustice can be worked by moving from one distribution to another structurally identical one, for the second, in profile the same, may violate people’s entitlements or deserts; it may not fit the actual history.”10 “Therefore, we do not yet know which one of the two men is the legitimate or just property owner. We can only find the answer through investigating the concrete data of the particular case, i.e., through ‘historical’ inquiry. Thus, we cannot simply say that the great axiomatic moral rule of the libertarian society is the protection of property rights, period. For the criminal has no natural right whatever to the retention of prop­erty that he has stolen; the aggressor has no right to claim any property that he has acquired by aggression.”11 Why must libertarians hold that private property, born out of the individual actions of people and determined in its justice by the justice of those originating actions, is a value that must be upheld? Again, first of all, it is simply a constituent property of what it means to be a libertarian in the sense that I have been using and in the sense that synthesis libertarianism is attempting to preserve; but secondly, it is because it is a necessary extension of the other principles so far. It is a construction of property which is based on the outcomes of individual actions within liberty, is equally applicable in its principles and rules to all people, and is necessary for people to preserve their own lives by their own hands and minds. 2.4. Proportionality Another component of libertarian value which is of primary importance is that of proportionality in justice. Although phrased barbarically, the old saying “an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth” really does sum up the libertarian approach to justice. A violation of someone’s liberty or property is to be met with a proportional, appropriate response, a violation in equal magnitude used either to prevent the violation from being consummated, or to produce restitution for a completed violation. This is what differentiates libertarians from other political philosophies in many ways: for instance, some progressives will advocate the use of the state — which operates on the basis of the threat of violence and kidnapping — to deal with violations of others that are not nearly so severe, even if they are undesirable: for instance, collusion to prevent someone from getting a job, or discrimination, or hate speech. These are undesirable things that actually violate the values I have previously outlined, but they are either the results of inaction on the part of the parties directly involved, or action that does not rise to the level of physical violence, and therefore to meet them with physical violence or the threat of it is a grossly disproportionate act. Furthemore, as part of making sense of this, it must be seen that the basis of whether something is a punishable crime is in the specific action that has been committed, and the extent to which it can be punished is in the specific action as well, as the punishment itself must be proportional to the action. Therefore, if no person or group was identifiably harmed, then harm cannot be done to a particular person or group in retaliation to that action in a proportional manner, because the action itself caused no harm to any particular person or group! This is why even those libertarians who view the state as legitimate tend to view it as a necessary evil, or an institution which should be limited to making laws against crimes which are proportional to the severity of the powers which it leverages to enforce its laws. This is also why libertarians, although they are interested in historical justice, are opposed to collective punishment based on ancestry or group membership. A few quotes will substantiate this point: [quote on how it is wrong to use the law to enforce against things that are not themselves violent] “I propose another fundamental rule regard­ing crime: the criminal, or invader, loses his own right to the extent that he has deprived another man of his. If a man deprives another man of some of his self-ownership or its extension in physical property, to that extent does he lose his own rights. From this principle immediately derives the proportionality theory of punishment-best summed up in the old adage: ‘let the punishment fit the crime.’”12 Why must this value be held by libertarians? Simply because, if it were to be held that any violation of liberty could be punished equally, then the subtle gaslighting and indoctrination of a religious group, or the oppressive but non-violent ostracism of a community committed to a particular tradition, could be punished with the same severity, if deemed necessary, as a terrorist attack or a school shooting. Likewise, the failure to give enough to charity, or hire someone for a job, or competition with someone for a job and beating them to be hired, might be offenses punishable by law, because although they are not violent actions, without a theory of proportionality, we would not be able to choose which things are rightly punishable by law and which are not outside of whether we like them or not. Hence without a theory of proportionality, it is very easy to go down a very authoritarian and restrictive route that is inherently antithetical to libertarianism. 2.5. The Initiation-Response Distinction This is the final, and perhaps most recognizable, libertarian value, although I have couched it in new terms for philosophical clarity. The fundamental distinction here is best elaborated by the idea of the Non-Aggression Principle: the idea that violence can only be justified when used in retaliation, for the purposes of defense or restitution, and is justified by the very fact that violence was initiated, or used, prior. In essence, it points out the fundamental and seemingly self-evident, yet surprisingly oft-missed, moral distinction between the initiation of violence against someone who has done nothing violent, and responding with violence to someone else who has used violence against you. It is possible to be a pacifist and condemn both these things, but there are morally relevant distinctions between them, so that to condemn both, either you would need to broaden your reasoning from what is commonly used, or use different reasoning for the condemnation of each type. Libertarians specifically value these two things differently: the initiation of a violation of someone’s liberty is morally reprehensible, while retaliation against it is at the very least morally neutral, and sometimes even morally praiseworthy. This view bleeds into many other libertarian views: views on when war is just (only in defense), when violence is just on a personal level (in self-defense or defense of others) and what the law can be used for (in response to actions, never prior to actions, further modified by considerations of proportionality). Here are some quotes: “Men have the right to use physical force only in retaliation and only against those who initiate its use. The ethical principle involved is simple and clear-cut: it is the difference between murder and self-defense. A holdup man seeks to gain a value, wealth, by killing his victim; the victim does not grow richer by killing a holdup man. The principle is: no man may obtain any values from others by resorting to physical force.”13 “No one may threaten or commit violence (‘aggress’) against another man’s person or property. Violence may be employed only against the man who commits such violence; that is, only defensively against the aggressive violence of another. In short, no violence may be employed against a nonaggressor. Here is the fundamental rule from which can be deduced the entire corpus of libertarian theory.”[14] This value is, in its essence, an extension of the principle of proportionality outlined above, in the sense that any action in retaliation to no action, or any violent action in retaliation to a non-violent one, is automatically and obviously unacceptable to a libertarian-minded person. 3. Social Leftism So far what we have stated should not be controversial: we have attempted to identify the values common to libertarians, and as such these values are generally agreed-upon in the community. Now, however, we must proceed to the true purpose of this manifesto: an analysis of how a consistent application of these values to more than merely politics and law — as would make sense for anyone who actually held these values, as values cannot be held only in certain cases and not others — leads to non-traditional, and leftist, social views. Let us examine why this is the case. 3.1. Anti-Traditionalism and Moderate Pluralism Following on from individual self-determination, many of the reasons that support a distrust or dislike of state intervention also support a distrust or dislike of social norms and traditions. If the state should not intervene in economic matters because each person is in a generally superior position to know what is best for them and those around them in comparison to a central authority, and central authorities are unable to adapt to change, then it follows that “society” (as a centralized institution of majority enforcement and tradition) does not know what is best for everyone when it comes to lifestyle either. It would be strange to argue that although a centralized authority is not competent to know what the best job or allocation of resources is for everyone, it would be competent to know what the best family structure or lifestyle is for everyone. Likewise, if in economic decisions it is best for human flourishing to allow human beings to make their own choices, using their reason and values and integrity, then how can it be otherwise in the case of social decisions, which are arguably more important to a person’s happiness in many cases? Thus we must say that tradition is to be viewed as a toolbox or selection of premade molds, which are to be chosen and evaluated by the reason of each individual in each individual case, and social enforcement of norms or normality is merely another form of illegitimate and stifling authority that is of very little use in most cases[15]. This must be extended to gender, sexuality, family structure, and every other corner of social life: every part of it must be subject to the reason of the individual, to be adapted to their unique situation and set of values. This implication is one even Rothbard himself seems to have grasped to some degree, although his social views did not fully encompass the implications here: “Meyer begins with the complaint that libertarians are really ‘libertines’… because we ‘reject’ the ‘reality’ of five thousand years of Western civilization, and propose to substitute an abstract construction. Very true; in other words, we, like Lord Acton, propose to weigh the growth of encrusted tradition and institutions in the light of man’s natural reason, and of course we find these often despotic institutions wanting.”14 We must also recognize — in what I call “moderate pluralism” — that while some things are universally good for human life and flourishing (such as liberty), there is a wide range within the limits set by those constants within which the proper values of humans can fall, so that what is right for the flourishing of one person may not be right for the flourishing of another. Therefore, although it is possible to say that some lifestyles are wrong, it is not possible to say that one, or even several, lifestyles are solely right. This is an extension of the economic idea that there are many values that human beings could pursue (within certain limits), and that to attempt to discover which set of values is right for each individual in order to enforce it is a foolhardy task, but that if it were possible to do so, then freedom would be unnecessary and perhaps even undesirable. Hence libertarians must not simply tolerate those who pursue different lifestyles, while doggedly sticking to traditions, but must instead value in themselves pluralism and non-traditionalism, attempting to strike out and discover what is best for their individual case while praising and valuing the social entrepreneurship of others who try still other lifestyles. Thus it is impossible to truly be a conservative — one who thinks that following tradition is the best thing to do for all people, and does so themselves, and finds others who do things they don’t do disgusting or degenerate — while holding libertarian values. 3.2. Anti-Authoritarianism Libertarians are generally defined, on the two-dimensional political compass, at least, as in opposition to authoritarians by default; as such, it might seem redundant and even comical to list this as a value that is not often shared by right libertarians nowadays and must be specified. However, I think that, like the other values, the dislike for authoritarianism which libertarians express concerning the state is not often applied elsewhere, both in the social and the economic world. Many libertarians decry the authoritarianism and paternalism of the state, but see no problem with priests, pastors, and patriarchs telling people what to do down to the smallest minutiae, or with bosses and CEOs who are so far removed from the process of production as to be completely ignorant of it making choices for workers all day long, ensuring that those workers become little more than mindless machines or trained animals. At this juncture, many libertarians will recoil with horror at our lambasting of these social and economic phenomena, retorting that these things are not (usually) born of coercion and violence and therefore libertarianism may have nothing to say concerning them. That is not so! The idea that, simply because a value cannot be enforced by law, it is outside the scope of valuation in political philosophy is a fallacy born of the too-long-extended existence of an invasive state; there are many other ways of pursuing and enforcing a value than mere violence, ways that both libertarians and authoritarians have forgotten. A true libertarian at heart, one which shares the values I have listed above, will not enjoy seeing the subjugation, even if voluntary and convenient, of one human being to another, the surrender of their will and reason to them, and the enforcement of this through any means whatsoever. Sometimes it is necessary or convenient, but it is never something one should seek or enjoy seeing. It is always, like some libertarians view the state to be, a necessary evil at best, and an unnecessary atrocity at worst. An overbearing father, pastor, priest, or patriarch can be as damaging to the flourishing of someone, and the operation and adaptation of the social community, as any government law, sometimes moreso; likewise, a surfeit of centralization in the economic world (whether through hierarchies of authority or through democratic means), or an overgrowth of corporatism and command-thinking, can be just as damaging to an economy as state intervention, although the latter is what usually leads to the former existing in damaging amounts. Furthermore, seeing all human beings as fundamentally morally equal, a libertarian must view any subordination or authority as a contingent and emergent phenomena, one which is not fundamental to the relation of one human being to another; thus the default, the null hypothesis if you will, is that there is no authority whatsoever, and any authority which wishes to establish itself must explain and justify its existence before a libertarian will bow to it. As Locke says, “there [is] nothing more evident, than that creatures of the same species and rank, promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature, and the use of the same faculties, should also be equal one amongst another without subordination or subjection…”15 The process of seeking such a justification for the state, as I have said previously, is seen in the social contract tradition. As Noam Chomsky, a noted anarchist but not libertarian, has said: “Hierarchic and authoritarian structures are not self-justifying. They have to have a justification. So if there is a relation of subordination and domination, maybe you can justify it, but there’s a strong burden of proof on anybody who tries to justify it. Quite commonly, the justification can’t be given. It’s a relationship that is maintained by obedience, by force, by tradition, by one or another form of sometimes physical, sometimes intellectual or moral coercion. If so, it ought to be dismantled. People ought to become liberated and discover that they are under a form of oppression which is illegitimate, and move to dismantle it.”16 3.3. Social Justice The fact that libertarians value justice in the current distribution of holdings, and view it as an outcome and consequence of the justice of the individual actions that led to that distribution, lends itself naturally to a concern for historical injustice. While a conservative may say that some historical injustice is not relevant to the present, because it took place in the past and was performed by no person alive today, as they are more concerned with protecting the actual holdings and distributions of the status quo, libertarians who find that historical injustice has taken part in the production of the current situation, being committed to the protection of the moral right to property and not the positive right, must view this as immediately relevant to current events and what actions they should take. This is not to say, necessarily, that libertarians must be in favor of reparations. After all, although most libertarian theories of property rights are very similar, the specific details of how they are justified and worked out can have large effects on what should be done about holdings that have an illegitimate or unjust history. Furthermore, there are many morally relevant differences between different cases; Rothbard’s theory of property and criminality, for instance, in dealing only with present cases of theft, has six distinct cases in which the proper action is entirely different. (As far as I know, too, very few libertarian theories of property rights have very much at all to say about inheritance not based on explicit contract, which makes dealing with historical injustices more difficult). Importantly, in addition, libertarians are primarily concerned with individuals. Therefore, the collective punishment aspect of reparations, which is often done on the basis of racial groups, is immediately at least suspect and to most libertarians, off the table. Nevertheless, the historical process by which current holdings are arrived at, and current states assign their positive property rights, should be of interest to libertarians, and they should seriously consider the implications of the fact that much property, especially in land, was originally claimed by conquest and genocide. It cannot be so easily dismissed, as Mises did in Human Action, by simply pointing out that most property is not held in a direct line of inheritance now that a market system is in place, either17; although this is a relevant factor, and perhaps indicates how a solution can be found and why those who own land now should not themselves be viewed as violent expropriators, it is not necessarily the last word on the issue. 5. Conclusion We hope to have shown, in this short manifesto, that to hold the values that provide a solid and consistent foundation for libertarianism consistently, social views that are fundamentally at odds with conservatism and reactionary thinking must be adopted as well. It is only possible to be a personally conservative libertarian to the extent that it is possible to tolerate cognitive dissonance, holding one set of values when force is involved, and one set of values when it is not. The commonly accepted fiction in the libertarian community of “thin libertarianism” is an impossible illusion. It is impossible because it puts forward the idea that as long as one holds certain beliefs, it does not matter what values undergird those beliefs, nor, if those beliefs are based on libertarian values, whether those libertarian values are held consistently. But those who do not share libertarian values can at best have a fleeting, insincere, and contingent libertarianism, and are murderous bedfellows indeed, and those who do not hold libertarian values consistently are open to cracks in their foundation of such a significant nature that it is a wonder that their beliefs do not crumble at a touch; moreover, those who profess to hold inconsistent values are prone to selecting one value set over another, and only pretending to maintain the other set, thereby often converting into the first type of insincere libertarian. Thin libertarianism was the dream of a strategy to radically grow a tiny and struggling movement, but it has ultimately failed, because it has led us to allow into our inner sanctums and philosophical cannon those who fundamentally do not care about the things we care about, do not value the things we value, and refuse to apply the values that they do share with us consistently. We have welcomed fascists into our ranks because they were willing to support property rights, we have welcomed religious reactionaries into our ranks because they were willing to support property rights, we have sold our souls for property rights — only to find out that the people we allied ourselves with don’t value liberty, don’t value property, they merely want to be free from the government because the government doesn’t do what they like, and as soon as the government does do what they like, or as soon as they can achieve power by some other means, they will do all they can to destroy what we value. Worse, they have corrupted and weakened our philosophical foundations, furthering the fiction that any value set can arrive at consistent and hearty libertarianism. This is a falsehood. Libertarianism must reclaim its soul, by recognizing its values and applying them consistently, and in doing so it must transition from merely a statement about when violence can be used, to a statement about what we value, what is good, what is desirable. We must realize that simply not condoning coercion and violence is not enough, that we cannot sit back and claim the moral high ground merely because we are not murderers and theives, and cannot expect anyone to want to be around us simply because we have done the bare minimum. There is more that a libertarian community must value and work towards. This will change what libertarianism is, fuse it with leftism and even a little socialism, but that is not something to lament or view as a necessary evil — those parts of these views which we synthesize into our position are merely the natural extension of what we already value, and so we should welcome a synthesis libertarianism with open arms, for it is a full embrace of what we already love so dearly.

&lt;p&gt;This essay has been on my mind for a long time. There is actually an embryonic form of it on this blog that I tried to write using voice dictation, but that just didn’t satisfy the itch, and so now that I’m feeling well enough to write and research real blog posts instead of voice dictated rants, I think its finally time to do this right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My social views have changed drastically even in the past half a year or so (as those who know me can attest), but they have changed even more drastically in the last three years, tracking at a delay with my ethical, political, philosophical, and theological views. As such, this blog post is going to function in two ways: it is going to function as a documentation of my progress in learning how reality actually works, and a response to the people, like the old me, who are transphobic not out of inherent fear or bigotry, but instead out of simple and correctable ignorance, and who have a desire to learn, as I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will take the form of a dialogue, where I will first, in bold, put forward the most challenging beliefs or questions my younger self had, and then I will explain why they are wrong. In essence, then: “Brain-Damaged Philosopher CALMLY DISMANTLES His Younger Self.” I hope you enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;definitions&quot;&gt;Definitions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender identity&lt;/strong&gt;: The internal, phenomenological experience of gender that every person has. This is tied into their personality, their behaviors, desired presentation, how they interact with other people, their interests, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender&lt;/strong&gt;: The external manifestation of gender identity, but also includes — to a certain degree, as you will see — physical aspects. Physical aspects are of secondary importance to gender designation, however, as will be shown.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biological sex&lt;/strong&gt;: Chromosomal content of the DNA. XX, XY, intersex, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;transgenderism-is-a-denial-of-basic-biology-you-cant-change-your-sex&quot;&gt;Transgenderism is a denial of basic biology. You can’t change your sex.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a good thing, then, that no transgender person actually claims to be able to change their biological sex! Although transgender people generally try to get their bodies and appearance to match their gender identity, they of course realize that rewriting the chromosomes in every one of their cells is an impossible task. However, gender is not identical to biological sex, so it is possible to change gender without changing sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason they try to do this is because they, like cisgender people, have a phenomenological, internal experience of identity and self that is gendered; their phenomenological experience of identity simply does not match the gender usually associated with their own biological sex.  This phenomenological experience is both a behavioral thing — how one desires to speak, dress, act, relate to others, body language, etc — and also a physical thing — what body parts one expects or does not expect to have, and whether one looks like how one imagines oneself internally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lest you doubt that it is possible to have a gender identity, imagine for a moment that you woke up in the body of the opposite gender. Would you feel at home? Would things be where you expected them to be? Would you want to &lt;em&gt;act&lt;/em&gt; like the typical person of the gender associated with that biological sex, or would you continue acting and dressing like &lt;em&gt;yourself&lt;/em&gt; — acting and dressing like the opposite gender to the one associated with your new biological sex? Would you, perhaps, phrase it as &lt;em&gt;being trapped in the opposite gender’s body?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;if-transgender-people-dont-claim-to-be-trying-to-change-their-biological-sex-why-do-they-want-to-be-referred-to-as-of-the-opposite-gender-to-their-biological-sex&quot;&gt;If transgender people don’t claim to be trying to change their biological sex, why do they want to be referred to as of the opposite gender to their biological sex?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gender, while it usually maps on to biological sex, is not defined purely in terms of biological sex. This should be obvious because of the fact that we can’t actually check the chromosomes of anyone we meet. Instead, we decide what gender to refer to them as, and treat them as, on the basis of how they act and present. A definition of gender purely in terms of chromosomal makeup is simply unusable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, such a definition simply does not match how we use gendered words. After all, in the case of intersex people, there are people who look physically almost identical to men, but have XX chromosomes (and female internal sex organs), and people who look physically female but have XY chromosomes (and male internal sex organs), and we already refer to them by the gender they present and identify as, instead of the gender that matches with their genes. There are also truly intersex people who have chromosomes that are neither XX nor XY, and we refer to them as the gender they choose to present as.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, defining gender in terms of reproductive capacity instead of presentation simply does not fit how we actually use the terms either, as we do not consider infertile women, or castrated men, no longer women or men. Most people who are infertile, of either gender, would in fact view the reduction of gender to reproductive capacity, or specific sexual organs, as insulting, demeaning, and dehumanising, as would most non-infertile people. Reducing womanhood, for instance, to being a baby incubation machine is silly and ridiculous, the kind of socially regressive nonsense only a conservative could concoct. Likewise, if to a lesser degree, reducing a man to an insemination machine is also dehumanizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is therefore clear from the above examples that the essentialist account of gender (and word definitions in general) simply fails. It does not describe how actual humans actually use language, as there are too many exceptions to any attempt to specify a specific set of binary properties that define what a word applies to. Instead, I think it is better — and I hold this position for philosophical reasons totally divorced from any social agenda I might have, I should add, based on my understanding of how proper abstraction and epistemology works — to view the definitions of words as a set of properties that can be satisfied to varying degrees, and different amounts of points are awarded to an object for satisfying those properties to various degrees. An object counts as having a certain word apply to it if the point score is obviously very high, and doesn’t count if the score is very low, but can fall into a gray area if the point score is in the middle. Think about whether cereal is a soup, or a hot dog is a sandwich. Like other words, then, gender actually refers to an entire nebulous and mostly socially constructed cloud of properties that can be satisfied to varying degrees, and as such, it is possible for a transgender person to fall under the definition of their preferred gender even if their chromosomes don’t match up. For instance, I think probably the most important part of gender is not the chromosomes, but how the person acts and thinks (their gender identity). After all, this determines more than anything else how well they fit in to the expectations and roles of a particular gender. So, since the gender identity and mind of a transgender person matches up with their preferred gender, they, in my opinion, &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; that gender in the way that matters most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In partial demonstration of this, I should point out that throughout the world and its history, many cultures have had vastly different ideas about how gender works: presentation, role in society, whether men or women are the more rational gender, etc. Many cultures have also often accepted more genders than just two.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;transgenderism-is-just-a-mental-illness-or-delusion-like-lycanthropy-not-an-actual-medical-condition&quot;&gt;Transgenderism is just a mental illness or delusion, like lycanthropy, not an actual medical condition.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, transgenderism cannot be a delusion because it makes reference to an internal phenomenological experience of self, not an external state of affairs. Transgender people aren’t claiming that they are of the opposite biological sex (an objectively verifiable fact), like people lycanthropy are claiming that they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; animals. They are instead describing an internal experience of expectation, identity, and emotion, and just like other first-person phenomenological experiences, one simply &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; be wrong about them. If I go up to a doctor saying I’m having a headache, it would be absurd for that doctor to tell me I’m not having a headache. The doctor could say that he can’t see a physical reason for the headache, but he can’t tell me I’m not feeling it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, according to the American Psychological Association, a psychological state is only considered a mental disorder or illness if the state inherently causes significant stress or disability. For instance, if someone is having paranoid delusions or lycanthropy, it is inherently distressing to them, because they &lt;em&gt;do not want&lt;/em&gt; to believe what the illness makes seem true to them. However, for transgender people, thinking of themselves as the opposite gender is not inherently distressing at all. Instead, what is distressing is “finding affordable resources, such as counseling, hormone therapy, medical procedures and the social support necessary to freely express their gender identity and minimize discrimination. Many other obstacles may lead to distress, including a lack of acceptance within society, direct or indirect experiences with discrimination, or assault.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, more and more research is indicating that there are structural, functional, and metabolic brain differences between transgender people and those that share their biological sex, such that they either appear outside the norm of both genders or fully inside the norm of the gender they identify as. As such, the only possible objectively extant thing that transgender people could be said to be referring to when they describe their experience of gender identity and dysphoria, the brain, appears to confirm their stories. This their gender identity is not merely a delusion. Below, I will list several studies that confirm this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-brains-of-transgender-people-operate-in-ways-more-similar-to-their-desired-gender-than-their-birth-sex&quot;&gt;The brains of transgender people operate in ways more similar to their desired gender than their birth sex.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We revealed a cerebral activation pattern in MTF transsexuals compared with male controls similar to female controls compared with male controls during viewing of erotic stimuli, indicating a tendency of female-like cerebral processing in transsexualism.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These data suggest a pattern of activation away from the biological sex [on the part of male-to-female transsexuals (MTFRs)], occupying an intermediate position with predominantly female-like features. Because our MFTRs were nonhomosexual, the results are unlikely to be an effect of sexual practice. Instead, the data implicate that transsexuality may be associated with sex-atypical physiological responses in specific hypothalamic circuits, possibly as a consequence of a variant neuronal differentiation. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-actual-neuronal-structures-of-the-brains-of-transgender-people-also-resemble-their-desired-sex-more-than-their-birth-one&quot;&gt;The actual neuronal structures of the brains of transgender people also resemble their desired sex more than their birth one.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We showed for the first time that INAH3 volume and number of neurons of male-to-female transsexual people is similar to that of control females. The female-to-male transsexual subject had an INAH3 volume and number of neurons within the male control range, even though the treatment with testosterone had been stopped three years before death. The castrated men had an INAH3 volume and neuron number that was intermediate between males (volume and number of neurons P &amp;gt; 0.117) and females (volume P &amp;gt; 0.245 and number of neurons P &amp;gt; 0.341). There was no difference in INAH3 between pre-and post-menopausal women, either in the volume (P &amp;gt; 0.84) or in the number of neurons (P &amp;lt; 0.439), indicating that the feminization of the INAH3 of male-to-female transsexuals was not due to estrogen treatment. We propose that the sex reversal of the INAH3 in transsexual people is at least partly a marker of an early atypical sexual differentiation of the brain and that the changes in INAH3 and the BSTc may belong to a complex network that may structurally and functionally be related to gender identity. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While most people take identification with their body for granted, conditions such as phantom limb pain, alien hand syndrome, and xenomelia suggest that the feeling of bodily congruence is constructed and susceptible to alteration. Individuals with xenomelia typically experience one of their limbs as over-present and aversive, leading to a desire to amputate the limb. Similarly, many transgender individuals describe their untreated sexed body parts as incongruent and aversive, and many experience phantom body parts of the sex they identify with (Ramachandran, 2008). This experience may relate to differences in brain representation of the sexed body part, as suggested in xenomelia (McGeoch et al., 2011)…  [The findings of this study] suggest that dysphoria related to gender-incongruent body parts in FtM individuals may be tied to differences in neural representation of the body and altered white matter connectivity.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;some-of-the-neurological-structures-of-transgender-people-are-neither-male-nor-female-but-grow-to-match-their-preferred-gender-after-treatment-indicating-why-hormone-therapy-is-so-important-as-it-returns-the-brain-to-a-more-normal-state&quot;&gt;Some of the neurological structures of transgender people are neither male nor female, but grow to match their preferred gender after treatment, indicating why hormone therapy is so important, as it returns the brain to a more normal state.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Differences between male and female control groups were found only in the auditory RSN, whereas differences between both control groups and MtFs were found in the auditory and fronto-parietal RSNs, including both primary sensory areas (e.g. calcarine gyrus) and higher order cognitive areas such as the middle and posterior cingulate and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Overall, differences in MtFs compared with men and women were more pronounced before cross-sex hormonal treatment. Interestingly, rs-FC between MtFs and women did not differ significantly after treatment. When comparing hormonally untreated and treated MtFs, we found differences in connectivity of the calcarine gyrus and thalamus in the context of the auditory network, as well as the inferior frontal gyrus in context of the fronto-parietal network.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The extant literature describing neuroimaging outcomes among transgender populations focuses primarily on questions of how similar the brain of the transgender individual is to their natal sex and whether use of GAHT [gender-affirming hormone therapy] enhances similarity between the brain of their natal sex and that of their desired gender. Most, but not all studies, indicate that the transgender individual is more similar to their preferred gender with respect to cerebral and gray matter volume and performance on gender-biased cognitive tasks (e.g., verbal and spatial tasks). There is a signal for GAHT to enhance the transgender individuals’ similarity to their preferred gender. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-should-be-focusing-on-convincing-transgender-people-that-they-are-of-the-gender-their-biological-sex-indicates-rather-than-allowing-them-to-transition-to-the-opposite-gender&quot;&gt;We should be focusing on convincing transgender people that they are of the gender their biological sex indicates, rather than allowing them to transition to the opposite gender.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, let’s go back to the thought experiment above. Imagine you woke up in the body of the opposite gender. You look in the mirror and don’t recognize yourself. When you move, it feels off. You are disgusted and disturbed by your new genitalia and secondary sex characteristics, and they feel strange and unfamiliar, foreign. Furthermore, you simply don’t want to act or dress like most of the other people who share your new biological sex. Could someone convince &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; that something wasn’t wrong? Could they convince you to start acting like a man or a woman, even if it felt wrong and artificial and you weren’t good at it? Could they convince you to start liking having sex as the opposite gender, using genitalia that you are disgusted and disturbed by in ways that are foreign to you? No? Then why expect it of transgender people?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, attempting to convince people they have a different gender identity (or sexual orientation) than they actually do has a long history. It’s called conversion therapy, and it is well accepted in the psychology community that it &lt;em&gt;does not work&lt;/em&gt;, and might even be harmful.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:9&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:9&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:10&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:10&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:23&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:23&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:24&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:24&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;letting-transgender-people-get-surgeries-so-they-can-match-their-preferred-gender-violates-the-hippocratic-oath-to-do-no-harm-plus-transgender-people-could-really-regret-making-such-drastic-moves&quot;&gt;Letting transgender people get surgeries so they can match their preferred gender violates the Hippocratic Oath to ‘do no harm.’ Plus, transgender people could really regret making such drastic moves.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, let’s just get one thing out of the way: just because someone does something they &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; regret, does not give anyone any license to discriminate against them, hate them, or anything like that. Also, as for the Hippocratic Oath, most medical schools don’t use it anymore. It has been overshadowed by more complicated medical codes of ethics and modified or entirely new oaths. Additionally, it should be noted that to claim that transgender surgery is ‘harm’ is to beg the question against the existence of transgender people, and moreover, we often do ‘mutilating’ surgeries (such as castration), when a greater medical need is known, and additionally doctors often perform cosmetic surgeries for no more reason than that the patient wants them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we do things we might regret, even seriously, all the damn time. Buying a house can send you into debt so bad you could end up homeless. Driving a motorcycle could leave you a vegetable or seriously injured (as could driving a car, for that matter). Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:11&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:11&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and most of those are very ugly. Nearly half of men and women in the US have experienced psychological abuse by an intimate partner&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:12&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:12&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Are we trying to stop people from doing any of these things? No? Why just transgender people, then? Many of these things are just as irreversible as transgender surgery. Additionally, not all transgender people even plan on &lt;em&gt;getting&lt;/em&gt; transgender surgery. After all, there are some risks involved, so even though they feel gender dysphoria and would want a body that matches their minds, they are aware of the risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it has been shown that gender affirming treatments greatly improve the mental health of transgender people:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We conducted a systematic literature review of all peer-reviewed articles published in English between 1991 and June 2017 that assess the effect of gender transition on transgender well-being. We identified 55 studies that consist of primary research on this topic, of which 51 (93%) found that gender transition improves the overall well-being of transgender people, while 4 (7%) report mixed or null findings. We found no studies concluding that gender transition causes overall harm. As an added resource, we separately include 17 additional studies that consist of literature reviews and practitioner guidelines.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:25&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:25&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We identified 28 eligible studies. These studies enrolled 1833 participants with GID (1093 male-to-female, 801 female-to-male) who underwent sex reassignment that included hormonal therapies… Pooling across studies shows that after sex reassignment, 80% of individuals with GID reported significant improvement in gender dysphoria (95% CI = 68–89%; 8 studies; I2 = 82%); 78% reported significant improvement in psychological symptoms (95% CI = 56–94%; 7 studies; I2 = 86%); 80% reported significant improvement in quality of life (95% CI = 72–88%; 16 studies; I2 = 78%); and 72% reported significant improvement in sexual function (95% CI = 60–81%; 15 studies; I2 = 78%).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:26&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:26&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[quoting from an article about a study instead of the study itself because the article does a better job of boiling the information down] In this study there were 3,398 patients, 16 mentioned regret or detransition. 12 attribute this to social pressure, and only 3 de-transitioned with no intention to transition again. That’s 3 people from a sample of 3,398 trans people. That’s 0.088% of people sampled. Literally less than 1 in 1000 people seeking treatment to aid transition. Therefore the successful treatment rate is 99.92% of people treated being trans, and happy with the results of treatment.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:27&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:27&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this first total population study of transgender individuals with a gender incongruence diagnosis, the longitudinal association between gender-affirming surgery and reduced likelihood of mental health treatment lends support to the decision to provide gender-affirming surgeries to transgender individuals who seek them.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:13&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:13&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There was significant difference between transsexual individuals before surgery and after surgery in mean score of happiness (P&amp;lt;0.01) (t=−4/84). Moreover, there was significant difference between the two groups in mean score of mental health (P&amp;lt;0.01) (f=19/13).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:14&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:14&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Current studies indicate that quality of life improves after sex reassignment surgery. The available studies are heterogeneous in design. In the future, prospective studies with standardized methods of assessing quality of life and with longer follow-up times would be desirable.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:15&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:15&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dr. Hess and colleagues surveyed 156 people who had all had gender reassignment surgery 6.61 years prior to the study, on average. The survey included open-ended questions regarding the participants’ “general, optical, and functional contentedness” with the surgery. The participants were also asked about their psychosocial well-being and quality of life. The latter was assessed at two different points in time throughout the transition process. Overall, 71 percent of the participants reported feeling very satisfied with the “optical and functional results” of the surgery, with 76.2 percent of the participants saying that they were able to achieve orgasms. The authors conclude: “We could detect a distinct improvement of general and trans-specific [quality of life] and psychosocial resources in our transgender cohort within [the] transition process.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:16&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:16&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about the claims of institutions like the Heritage Foundation? Quoting from one of their articles on the subject (warning for those who want to read the article: insane amounts of transphobia and misgendering are contained within):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When ‘the tumult and shouting dies,’ it proves not easy nor wise to live in a counterfeit sexual garb. The most thorough follow-up of sex-reassigned people—extending over 30 years and conducted in Sweden, where the culture is strongly supportive of the transgendered—documents their lifelong mental unrest. Ten to 15 years after surgical reassignment, the suicide rate of those who had undergone sex-reassignment surgery rose to 20 times that of comparable peers.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:17&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:17&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with this, of course, is that it misunderstands the &lt;em&gt;purpose&lt;/em&gt; of sex-reassignment surgery. The point is to make life as a transgender person more bearable — which it demonstrably does. It is not, and no one has ever claimed it would be, a cure-all. Of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt;, if you were to find yourself in the body of the wrong gender, no matter how much you modified it, you would be unhappy with it. Additionally, the Heritage Foundation misreads the study they cite on several levels. First of all, the conclusion of the study outright says that SRS relieves gender dysphoria, which is what it is supposed to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Persons with transsexualism, after sex reassignment, have considerably higher risks for mortality, suicidal behaviour, and psychiatric morbidity than the general population. Our findings suggest that sex reassignment, &lt;strong&gt;although alleviating gender dysphoria,&lt;/strong&gt; may not suffice as treatment for transsexualism, and should inspire improved psychiatric and somatic care after sex reassignment for this patient group.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:18&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:18&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second of all, just because Sweden is very LGBTQ+ friendly &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, does not at all imply that it was in the 1970s, which was when most of the people who were studied transitioned. In fact, I find it highly implausible that it would have been even &lt;em&gt;remotely&lt;/em&gt; transgender friendly at the time. Therefore, much of the increased mental illness seen in the transgender people studied when compared to the general population could well be from trauma caused in earlier life, from before Sweden was so accepting. Indeed, it could be trauma caused simply from having to live as the wrong gender for so long before they could get a surgery. Additionally, SRS techniques have come a very long way since the 1970s, which could certainly play a role in the mental illness of transgender people who had the operation at that time. Furthermore, the study was concluded in 2011. That’s a decade ago, and we’re still dealing with transphobia today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;its-okay-for-adults-to-do-whatever-they-want-with-their-bodies-but-letting-a-child-transition-is-child-abuse&quot;&gt;It’s okay for adults to do whatever they want with their bodies, but letting a child transition is child abuse!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is simply untrue that children are being medically transitioned. Those under the age of eighteen (the age of legal consent) are not provided with hormone therapy or surgery of any kind. They are instead referred to a therapist whose job is — unlike paranoid conservatives seem to thing — not to support the child in whatever they want to do, nor to convince them to “become” transgender, but instead to figure out if they actually are transgender, and strongly avoid having them go through the difficult process of coming to terms with that if they are not &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; transgender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, yes, some children are given puberty blockers during this process, but this is in fact to &lt;em&gt;prevent&lt;/em&gt; an irreversible and possibly quite harmful change. It gives the therapist and the child and the parents more time to figure out what to do, that’s all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I think it is clear that there is a difference between real dysphoria and the normal babble, play, and pretend of children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-idea-that-there-is-an-inherent-difference-between-male-and-female-brains-contradicts-the-feminists-transgenderism-and-feminism-are-at-war-and-thus-we-see-how-social-progressivism-eats-itself&quot;&gt;The idea that there is an inherent difference between male and female brains contradicts the feminists! Transgenderism and feminism are at war, and thus we see how social progressivism eats itself.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not a universal, or even very common, belief among feminists that there is no inherent difference between men and women. There is a small group of radical feminists, who are generally rejected by other feminists and most of the rest of the socially progressive community, that deny this, but this does not imply that transgenderism is incorrect or that progressivism is a failure. This is tantamount to pointing out an ideological difference between different conservative ideologies — perhaps between paleoconservatives and neoconservatives — and using this as evidence that one or both are wrong, or that conservatism as an ideology is incoherent. Furthermore, these trans-exclusionary radical feminists (TERFS) are simply scientifically wrong. Here is a quote from the abstract of a meta-analysis (the strongest form of scientific evidence) on the subject:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Studies of perception, cognition, memory and neural functions have found apparent gender differences. These differences may be attributed to various genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors and do not reflect any overall superiority advantage to either sex. Both sexes are equal in intelligence, but tend to operate differently. Men and women appear to use different parts of the brain to encode memories, sense emotions, recognize faces, solve certain problems and make decisions. Indeed, when men and women of similar intelligence and aptitude perform equally well, their brains appear to go about it differently, as if nature had separate blueprints. Sex differences in the brain may play a role in learning processes, language development, and progression of neurologically-based diseases. Sex differences need to be considered in studying brain structure and function and may raise the possibility of sex-specific treatments for neurological diseases.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:19&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:19&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, many (most?) feminists seem instead to &lt;em&gt;emphasize&lt;/em&gt; the inherent differences between men and women, talking about positive things that are unique to women and — in the case of care ethics at least — trying to construct philosophies that use feminine insights that have been absent in the philosophical canon so far due to its domination by men. What feminists dispute is that women are any less capable, intelligent, or rational than men. Not that they are different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-shouldnt-let-transgender-women-compete-in-womens-sports-men-have-a-lot-more-stamina-and-strength-and-so-on-so-they-would-have-an-unfair-advantage&quot;&gt;We shouldn’t let transgender women compete in women’s sports. Men have a lot more stamina and strength and so on, so they would have an unfair advantage.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the scientific studies I could find indicate that trans women remain stronger than the average cis woman even after they transition, although their strength does decrease significantly.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:20&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:20&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; However, this does not necessarily mean that trans women should not be included in women’s sports. For one thing, not all sports make the kind of extra muscle mass trans women have advantageous. For another, cis women who have hormone abnormalities that make them significantly stronger than normal cis women, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/tokyo-olympics-live-updates/2021/07/28/1021503989/women-runners-testosterone-olympics&quot;&gt;such as Caster Semenya&lt;/a&gt;, who have long been included in competition with their own gender would also be excluded from competition if we started deciding who could compete in women’s sports based on muscle mass or testosterone levels, etc. If you want to exclude trans women, you have to exclude some cis women too, if you’re going to actually base the exclusion on some scientific and performance basis. Meanwhile, if you simply &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; exclude trans women, then you are discounting that some cis women have the same biological advantage, and so it is clear that what you want is not a leveling of the playing field of biological advantage, but instead simply to act out your transphobia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, in these discussions, trans men are never brought up, when they should be. If a trans man is on testosterone, he will be much stronger than equivalent cis women. This would seem to argue for trans men being allowed to compete with their desired gender, but trans women not being allowed to do so, which is strange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will admit that this specific issue is a bit of a problem. But the solution is not as obvious as conservatives like to think it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;if-we-have-to-respect-self-identification-as-a-certain-gender-we-could-end-up-letting-sexual-predators-into-the-bathrooms-of-the-opposite-gender-along-with-transgender-people&quot;&gt;If we have to respect self-identification as a certain gender, we could end up letting sexual predators into the bathrooms of the opposite gender along with transgender people!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, if you’re worried about a man going to the bathroom with your wife/daughter/girlfriend, etc, think about how a real trans woman would feel going to the bathroom in the men’s bathroom, surrounded by actual men? Especially when most trans women pass as women, and there is a long history of men assaulting trans women?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or imagine how uncomfortable it would be for a trans man to be in the women’s bathroom, presenting as a man? It will look for all the world as if there is a man in the women’s bathroom, &lt;em&gt;because there fucking is&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, there is at least one study showing that public accommodation nondiscrimination ordinances simply don’t have any discernible effect on the actual occurrence of the crimes conservatives fear on this front:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This study presents findings from matched pairs analyses of localities in Massachusetts with and without gender identity inclusive public accommodation nondiscrimination ordinances. Data come from public record requests of criminal incident reports related to assault, sex crimes, and voyeurism in public restrooms, locker rooms, and dressing rooms to measure safety and privacy violations in these spaces. This study finds that the passage of such laws is not related to the number or frequency of criminal incidents in these spaces. Additionally, the study finds that reports of privacy and safety violations in public restrooms, locker rooms, and changing rooms are exceedingly rare. This study provides evidence that fears of increased safety and privacy violations as a result of nondiscrimination laws are not empirically grounded.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:21&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:21&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, one psychological study found that “sensitivity to pathogen disgust was positively associated with support for bathroom restrictions; sexual and injury disgust were unrelated. We also examined the role of disgust-driven moral concerns, known as purity concerns, as well as harm-related moral concerns in support for bathroom restrictions. While concerns about harm to cisgender and transgender people predicted support for bathroom restrictions, purity was a much stronger predictor. Also, purity partially mediated the link between pathogen disgust and support for bathroom restrictions, even after accounting for harm concerns. Findings and implications are discussed.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:22&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:22&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, a scenario where a sexual predator crossdresses and uses this to sneak into the bathrooms of the opposite gender is just really far-fetched and unlikely. It seems like conservatives are more just grossed out by transgender people than they are actually concerned about something like this happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;10&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;there-never-used-to-be-transgender-people-but-now-their-numbers-are-increasing-rapidly-trans-acceptance-is-just-encouraging-confused-people&quot;&gt;There never used to be transgender people, but now their numbers are increasing rapidly. Trans acceptance is just encouraging confused people.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you think someone could convince &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; that you had a different gender identity? No? Then why do you think it’s possible for others?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if you want to start transitioning in a way that is even remotely irreversible — hormone therapy, gender affirmation surgery — you have to first speak with a psychologist, who will try to establish that you actually have gender dysphoria, and who will walk you through all of the dangers and downsides of transitioning. Only after they have given you the go-ahead, usually after two or more visits, can you even begin the process. Then, when you are approved, you are given hormones, but doctors calibrate them very carefully to your physiology, and will only give them to you if you are healthy to begin with. You will get regular checkups to make sure everything is going fine and nothing dangerous is happening. Only after you have been living as the opposite gender and taking hormones for &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; a year will doctors even consider giving you surgery. This is to make sure that you are &lt;em&gt;absolutely positive&lt;/em&gt; that this is the right move.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:28&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:28&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s not as if someone can just get an idea in their head from watching media or whatever and run off and do irreversible damage to themselves. The worst case scenario for a confused cis person is that they socially transition for a bit — wearing the clothes and using the pronouns of the opposite gender — realize it isn’t for them, and give up. And even that is likely very rare, for exactly the reason that gender identity is a very innate, phenomenological experience that isn’t really changeable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why are we seeing an increase of transgender people, if more aren’t being created by society “pushing the gay agenda”? We are seeing an increase for the same reason that we saw an increase in left-handed people after left-handedness stopped being stigmatized and schools and parents stopped trying to teach left-handed people to use their right hand to do things&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:29&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:29&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;: more people are openly &lt;em&gt;admitting&lt;/em&gt; that they are transgender, both to themselves, and to others. Transgender people always existed, they just didn’t show up in society and on polls because they were hiding, or even suppressing, their true natures. This explains the data just as well as the theory that people are “becoming” transgender, but it does not require dubious psychological assumptions. Furthermore, it better explains why there is a phenomenon of older people born in less accepting generations transitioning now, in the modern day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;11&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;be-that-as-it-may-i-refuse-to-respect-the-chosen-namespronouns-of-transgender-people-respect-must-be-earned&quot;&gt;Be that as it may, I refuse to respect the chosen names/pronouns of transgender people. Respect must be earned!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you disagree with what I have said in the previous sections about transgender people actually &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; their preferred gender in the way that matters most — such that not using the correct pronouns would actually make &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; the confused and incorrect one — there are other considerations. Do you run around insulting people as much as you want, whenever you want, until they &lt;em&gt;earn&lt;/em&gt; your respect? No? Why? Because insulting people is harmful and rude? Well, so is using the wrong pronoun, as it can actually create severe psychological distress, similar to calling someone the N-word or the F-word. Also, if someone asks you to call them by a nickname, do you just completely ignore them, and rant about how they haven’t earned your respect or that their &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; name isn’t that name? No? Then why do it to transgender people? It seems, in the case of names and pronouns, that conservatives actually want a suspension of the normal rules of social decency and empathy. That seems odd, if their basis for doing so is supposedly in not letting transgender people change the rules. (It isn’t, it’s based in transphobia.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine that someone’s given name is tied up in very traumatic and hurtful memories — perhaps they grew up in a strict fundamentalist religious household and have real trauma connected to religious abuse — for them. If they ask you to use a nickname instead, would you refuse to use it, because it isn’t their “actual” name? No? Then why not use the “nicknames” that trans people use? Not to mention that many trans people actually get their name legally changed. Are you going to refuse to use their actual name merely because you don’t think that their name matches how they look? If so, why do you not just arbitrarily rename people based on how they look to you in general?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;12&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;transgenderism-is-equivalent-to-transracialism-or-transpeciesism-or-transageism&quot;&gt;Transgenderism is equivalent to ‘transracialism’ or ‘transpeciesism’ or ‘transageism’.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a false equivalency, and a very dangerous and harmful one at that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with the first equivocation is that while gender is an inherently internal, phenomenological experience of self and identity — which usually shows up very early in a child’s development and is very consistent when it does&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:30&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:30&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; — race is defined purely in terms of external, physical characteristics. There is no internal experience that people of color have that inherently is different from white people, no ‘what it is like to be black’ that differs from the general human experience apart from &lt;strong&gt;externally imposed&lt;/strong&gt; sociocultural factors, and no inherent behavioral or cognitive differences either. There is no such thing as ‘acting black’ or ‘acting white’, only acting like the cultures that are generally &lt;em&gt;associated&lt;/em&gt; with those races. Therefore, there is &lt;strong&gt;no way&lt;/strong&gt; for race dysphoria to exist: there is no internal marker that someone could have that would tell them that they are the ‘mind’ of a black person in a white person’s body, for instance. They could &lt;em&gt;like the culture&lt;/em&gt; of another race more or identify it more, but that’s not being transracial, that’s wanting to imitate a different culture, and that happens all the time. It’s cringey, sure, but there are white rappers and black Vikings and nobody really cares that much. Since there is no way for race dysphoria to exist, those who are trying to be “transracial” are clearly doing it for some other reason, and that reason is probably not exactly wholesome, hence the vitriol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with the second equivocation is similar. There is nothing that it is ‘like’ to be a dog or a cat. They’re not conscious creatures. Nor is it possible for a human’s brain to resemble a dog or a cat more than a human brain. There can’t be such a thing as species dysphoria. Furthermore, taking on the roles and behaviors of animals just isn’t possible, healthy, or advisable for a member of the human species, whereas the roles and behaviors of the genders are specifically possible for human beings and taking them on isn’t inherently harmful regardless of your biological sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for transageism, well, that’s a different thing entirely. If your mind actually does resemble that of a younger or older person, that’s an occurrence that we actually recognize and deal with accordingly: if an adult’s mind resembles that of a child, they are mentally impaired and are usually given caretakers. Likewise if a young person’s mind starts resembling a person of a much older age, such as developing dementia, this is not denied, but instead treated. In between these extremes, people often do not act ‘their age,’ acting in more or less mature ways, dressing in more or less mature ways, etc, and nobody bats an eye. This could be seen as ‘transitioning’ to a different age. However, again, like in the previous examples, outside of the extremes of age there really isn’t a set phenomenological experience that characterizes ‘what it is like to be a certain age,’ and therefore no internal phenomenological markers that can make someone transage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, for all three of these examples, the people that exemplify them — and necessarily all people that do — do so as an active choice. They choose to identify as something else, instead of already, necessarily identifying as that thing. Furthermore, when they ‘transition,’ they faced no serious psychological distress (unlike transgender people) if they did not do so. They simply wanted to, for whatever reason. This is very different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservatively minded people often try to justify an institution, belief, or practice using evolutionary arguments. For example, they would look at something like religion and argue that since it has been around for so long it must be advantageous to humanity, otherwise it would not still be around. A variation of this argument goes like this: a good idea will lead to a more prosperous society, which will help the society spread it even further. These arguments rely on evolutionary misconceptions, however. My goal is to clear up some of these misconceptions, describe some of the ways that evolution works, and describe a theory that I think is more plausible in many of these situations: meme theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-meme-theory&quot;&gt;What is meme theory?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the book The Selfish Gene, which was published in 1976, Richard Dawkins defines a gene as a biological unit of information that can replicate itself. He goes on to address many misconceptions people have about evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a very interesting book, and so are his other books. But the area I’m focusing on now is the last chapter of the Selfish Gene, where he coins the word meme. He defines meme as a cultural unit of selection that can replicate itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To him, there are three important criteria for evolution by natural selection to take place:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There must be reproduction of information from generation to generation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There must be mutations to this information.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;These changes / the content of this information should have some impact on the likelihood of reproduction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice how biochemical encoding is not mentioned here. This is what leads him to conclude that some other encoding, such as in our brains or in a computer, could work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, throughout most of his book, he often talks about “replicators” rather than genes because he wants to focus on the function rather than the structure since biology often defies taxonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, whilst genes are encoded in DNA or RNA or some other biochemical structure, memes are encoded as neural patterns, and live in our brains. They can pass from person to person. He uses the example of a catchy song that makes someone want to sing it. If they sing it around other people, they also want to sing it, and so it spreads from person to person, with minor changes along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it doesn’t have to be a song. It can be something else, like a religion, or an idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dawkins says that the same forces of natural selection that apply to genes also apply to memes. And that they can often be better explanations for certain phenomena than biological advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-case-for-meme-theory&quot;&gt;The case for meme theory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to demonstrate meme theory in practise, I need to identify a concept that fulfils the 3 criteria for natural selection and can therefore be called a meme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example could be language. People mostly speak the same language as their parents. But not necessarily their biological parents. If an infant with Mandarin speaking biological parents was adopted by English speaking parents, they will speak English rather than Mandarin. Thus language reproduces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Language also undergoes mutation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;English has changed since Chaucer. It’s been about 30 generations since his writing. Each generation since then can communicate with the next and previous generation without too much difficulty, but it wouldn’t be that easy for people 10 generations apart to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is evidence that the meme-pool of ideas changes over time, i.e mutates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the content/effect of those memes has an impact on it’s reproductive success. New words crop up in slang all the time, but many of them are abandoned. Some of them make their way into dictionaries and regular usage. Words that are centred around technologies that are no longer in use themselves become unused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that language fulfils all 3 criteria necessary for evolution by natural selection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is no gene for the English language. The ability to speak it is not impacted by having English speaking biological parents. This makes it a meme, rather than a gene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use meme theory to make predictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do popular religions say about teaching children about the religion? How many of them say “wait until the child is an adult and able to make their own decisions before asking them what religion to believe in. Make sure you don’t teach them your religion as a fact, instead tell them that it’s your belief but you could be wrong”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll wait. If a religion did that, it would not have many adherents. Even if you believe a religion is true, my point still stands for other religions. In fact, every major religion commands parents to teach their children about the religion so that they follow it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most major religions also command their adherents to have many children. “Go forth and multiply”. Combined with indoctrinating children into the faith, this obviously has an impact on the number of future believers of the religion who go on to do the same thing with their own children. What do you think would happen if, instead, religion taught people to delay and minimise having children to ensure the best possible life, like a responsible person? You’d get one, maybe two children per believer, which is no competition for 5 children per religious believer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do major religions teach about interacting with non-believers? Being friends with them? Or even being in a relationship with them? If they don’t outright prohibit it they clearly command reducing it to a minimum. What impact does it have? For most people, the plausibility of an idea depends on the proportion of people that they know who have that idea. And if they don’t hear a competing idea, they are less likely to give up their original one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now how about this, how many popular religions ask for proselytising? Both Christianity and Islam do, Judaism doesn’t. And Islam and Christianity have over a billion believers each, whilst Judaism has 14.7 million. Christianity and Islam are both offshoots of Judaism, with a few other differences, but I think this is telling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you agree with me so far we’ve established this: some ideas change over time because of their ability to propagate themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;objections-to-meme-theory&quot;&gt;Objections to meme theory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of objections made to meme theory, but many of them would also apply to genes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, one objection is the difficulty of identifying the physical medium where the memes are encoded. This would also apply to genes. Near the beginning of the Selfish Gene, Dawkins describes a few different physical representations that people point to when they talk about genes, and shows how biochemistry is too complicated to have a simple rule for what counts as a gene and what doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of going by their structure, he decides to go by the function. If something is biologically encoded and functions as a gene, that’s good enough. By functions as a gene, I mean it fulfils the three criteria mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next objection is that it’s not amenable to scientific testing and is offered as just-so explanations. I don’t see why this is the case. It’s much easier to create a meme than a gene, making it easier to test in certain ways. People also often create just-so stories with genetic explanations. Meme theoretic explanations can also be used to make predictions and decide where to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another objection is that a meme is just another word for concept. But that makes as much sense as saying that a gene is just another word for trait. Ok it makes more sense than that. But the point is that Dawkins’s insight is that the forces of evolution by natural selection apply to concepts, and when he’s talking about concepts in the context of natural selection, he uses the word meme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-evolutionary-forces-impact-genes-and-memes&quot;&gt;What evolutionary forces impact genes and memes?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I’ve covered why meme theory is not pseudo-science. To properly understand the implications, I need to explain some evolutionary forces and clear up some misconceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-group-selection&quot;&gt;On group selection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest misconceptions laymen have about evolution via natural selection is that the selection criteria is concerned with the good of the species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the case. Evolution doesn’t work for the benefit of the species. It also doesn’t work for the benefit of the individual. Although, if you assume that, you’ll be less wrong than assuming it works for the benefit of the group. Evolution works for the benefit of the gene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a gene that caused a member of a species to steal food from others. And imagine that this makes the individual less likely to starve and more likely to reproduce. This gene would spread. Even if it caused other members of the species to starve. And if this gene become widespread, the species can run out of food and die out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But doesn’t that mean only species where members don’t steal from each-other remain? Isn’t that the kind of higher-order selection I said didn’t happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, no. And here’s why. Species don’t reproduce. Genes do. There aren’t two versions of a species, one with a trait and one without, with the species with the trait going on to become more numerous. But there are individuals, some with a good gene and some without, and those with the gene are better able to increase the frequency of that gene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as the species is not wiped out, where there is a tension between the gene becoming more prevalent and the society being better off, the gene will win. If it ends up killing the species it will, but if it doesn’t then the gene will reproduce even if it leaves the species worse off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t help the conservative argument. All that can be said is that the tradition doesn’t make humanity extinct (or hasn’t yet), which is a pretty low bar. It can screw other humanity as long as it perpetuates itself and doesn’t wipe them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Dawkins’ main point in The Selfish Gene is that group selection is a faulty way of thinking about evolution, and that that gene selection can explain far more predictively when we would expect to see altruistic behaviour as a result of genes being shared by other individuals in the same species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As J.B.S Haldane said: “I would lay my life for two brothers or 8 cousins.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that altruism occurs is an expected consequence of gene-centred selection. The level of altruism and the recipients is also predicted by gene-centred selection and the way that genes are shared among individuals. This means that the organism-centred selection that Darwinism was implicitly operating under was also incorrect. It also means that the interests of the gene is sometimes aligned with more than just the individual with the particular copy of the gene, but other individuals with the same gene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it also shoots down the idea that evolution is a rosy species centred utilitarian. Individuals do have different interests, and these interests can and do overcome what the species centred utilitarian would prefer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s like the prisoner’s dilemma: Although the average best outcome for everyone is if no-one betrays the other, every actor can improve their position by betrayal and so in a system where they cannot converse and plan, betrayal is the decision that will almost always be chosen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you start thinking of the replicator as helping itself, then you can also apply this to memes. The human host is just an environment the meme will try to exploit for the purpose of propagating itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;local-optimum&quot;&gt;Local Optimum&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evolution does not make huge changes in a single generation. It makes small incremental changes each generation. If a change in one generation is worse than the previous generation, it will not prevail. But sometimes things have to get worse before they get better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re improving a building, then you have to temporarily render at least a section of it unusable, making the building worse than it was before, so that you can make it even better. Evolution can’t do this, so it’s stuck with local optima.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you are near the peak of a hill. The peak is to your left. But to your right, after you go down a bit, is an even bigger hill. If you want the best possible outcome, you will go to the right. But if you don’t want any step to leave you lower than you were one step before, you would go to the left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason this is important is because as humans who can plan ahead and reason, we are not constrained towards having to follow local optima. Even if a tradition is good for the species, we can use our reason to do better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;explanation-at-another-level&quot;&gt;Explanation at another level&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When teachers introduce programming for the first time, they often ask students to come up with a list of instructions for making something such as a cup of tea. The teacher then proceeds to follow the instructions the students have come up with in a comically literal fashion that even genies think is pedantic. The teacher would also ask what something means and require more detailed instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, “how do I boil water”, “how to I turn on the kettle”, or turning on an empty kettle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point behind this is that evolution and our upbringing allows us to understand all that goes into making a cup of tea unconsciously and makes it feel simple. But a computer doesn’t have this prior knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evolution is similar. If you’re making a gene to achieve a certain result, it has to occur through a series of lower level steps such that the release of certain chemicals at the right place and time inadvertently results in the eventual effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, instead of a gene in beavers that just says “make a better dam”, it’s more likely that a gene would result in a difference in size in beaver legs that leads them to swim at different depths and collect different kinds of branches. We can then look at all of these effects (longer legs, swimming at different depths, better dams), and decide which one is responsible for increased reproductive success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider something like using Facebook or Twitter or whatever social media platform kids these days use. You can look at in in one of the following two ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People evolved to use Facebook. People that used it spread their genes more frequently than people that didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People use Facebook because humans are social, humans are capable of language, and they are tool users. FaceBook fills their socialising fix. Being social, capable of language, having tool using abilities all contribute towards reproductive success.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the second one is often far more plausible. Because it’s unlikely that genes can code for FaceBook directly, and because use of Facebook varies faster than human generations do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The characteristics and behaviours of an organism is called its phenotype. This can be thought of as the effects of its genes and environment interplaying together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often there is a chain of causality from gene to phenotype, and all of these effects can have an impact on the reproductive success of the organism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vestigial-evolution&quot;&gt;Vestigial evolution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An evolutionary vestige is something that has lost all or most of the function it was initially evolved for. Sometimes it takes on a new function. Other times it has little to no function. If it has no cost to evolutionary fitness, there is no pressure to remove it, so it remains. There are about 180 vestigial organs in the human body, and the animal kingdom is full of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an interesting one: goosebumps. There are homologous structures in apes that cause their hair to raise when they are scared so that they look larger and more intimidating. Since we’re hairless apes, this doesn’t do anything for us other than make us feel weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe something was originally “good for the species”, but isn’t any more, and was copied because most people appeal to tradition rather than rationally evaluate things. Historically this has happened very frequently, and dropping these customs often resulted in increased prosperity.
Anthropological findings can often make strange seeming customs make sense for the context that they developed in. For example, in societies where men were killed in wars, there were far more women than men and so men married multiple women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in a world where we don’t have many men being killed in wars, it no longer makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;parasites-and-arms-races&quot;&gt;Parasites and arms races&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A gene that successfully results in enabling the individual to navigate the environment that it is in and reproduce will spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is meant by environment here? Anything external to the gene. That means other organisms, including the same species. That even includes other genes in the same organism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same way that a cheetah that can run a little faster can catch a deer and live to reproduce, a baby bird that can make louder noises so its mother gives it more food. Or, a cuckoo can create an egg that looks more similar to a reed warbler’s egg to better fool the warbler into raising cuckoo offspring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This creates conflict. The deer wants to run faster to not get eaten by the cheetah. The parent does not want to give one child more food at the expense of the others. The warbler wants to spot cuckoo eggs better so they don’t waste energy on birds that aren’t their genetic offspring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so you end up with evolutionary arms races, which eventually result in very sophisticated phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not good for the warbler to be tricked by the cuckoo. The warbler gets better and better at noticing cuckoo eggs. But cuckoos just get better at making eggs that looks like warbler eggs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same can be true of traditions that are harmful to people, but evolve to come to overcome defence mechanisms people deploy against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, parasites often go quite deeply. They make use of existing infrastructure developed for the sake of the host organism, and pervert it towards the ends of the parasite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Dawkins often describes the individual organism as a machine made by the gene with the sole purpose of reproducing the gene. “Copy me by the roundabout way of creating an elephant with the reproductive capacity of creating another elephant”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More and more components are added to this machine as the generations pile on. This enables the body to respond in the correct way to inputs from the external environment to maximise reproductive success. For example, a central nervous system and other neural connections to move in the right way in response to certain electrical and chemical impulses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like a hacker, a parasite can tap into this pre-existing infrastructure by providing the right input in the right location to make the host do its bidding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a cell is a factory for creating more copies of the cell. It can take combine amino acids into another cell, and copies the nucleus into this. However, a virus can take over the cell, and take advantage of the existing machinery to make more copies of the virus instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this way a meme can be viewed as analogous to foreign genetic material inside the human body that can make the body act differently. It does not necessarily have aligned interests with the human host, and can even subvert the person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this does not mean it will always be antagonistic. There are beneficial symbiotic relationships in nature. Chloroplasts and mitochondria merged together at one point in history. Mitochondria actual have their own separate genetic material, inherited through the maternal line. Dawkins goes into more detail regarding when a relationship is parasitic or symbiotic, with method of reproduction being one of the main criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;back-to-the-argument&quot;&gt;Back to the argument&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, the first argument doesn’t work because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Memes evolve at a different level than the host species, and they evolve to spread themselves, not spread the species&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Evolution does not occur for the benefit of the group&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Evolution only seeks local optima&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Conflicting interests exist&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are things that used to have a useful evolutionary function but no longer do&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Other traits in the chain of causality between the gene and the outcome could be what is selected from&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second argument does not work for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Truly popular ideas are common even, or perhaps especially, in non-prosperous societies. Take Religion for instance, religiosity is positively correlated with poverty. This should be obvious, whatever the most prosperous society does must by definition be uncommon. If the reason for prosperity was common, prosperity would also be common.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In every society there are a multitude of ideas, and it takes a good statistician to identify which are the ideas that lead to prosperity and which didn’t, which is very complex, and not helped by the fact that statistics is very unintuitive to most people. Most effects are pretty marginal, suffer a time-lag, and there is no review board to check whether a custom has worked before propagating it the next generation. Even if people are worse off, they can point to some other cause rather than the real cause, or they can even double down on the custom.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What if the rational process of noticing that a tradition is harmful is part of the evolutionary process the proponent of this argument is extolling? “We shouldn’t replace traditions because bad traditions get replaced with good ones” is a peculiar argument.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I will explain why I think that meme theory is often a better explanation than a genetic explanation in these cases, and why that will probably result in a different assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-to-prefer-meme-theory&quot;&gt;When to prefer meme theory?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been convinced that meme theory is a thing, then when you see an institution or concept in human societies that aren’t present in other species I think your priors should be roughly equal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it’s something that has varied across different human societies, I think that this should increase the likelihood of meme theory. Especially if it’s something that has changed within a generation. A meme can go through many more reproductive cycles in the same time-frame than a gene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gene theory requires a difference in the reproduction of the genes of the person with the gene. If there was a genetic explanation, you would expect to see this difference in reproductive success in people who hold it. But if there are people who don’t hold it and have the same reproductive success, that indicates that it’s probably not genetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-can-we-do-with-meme-theory&quot;&gt;What can we do with meme theory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that some of the concepts I’ve built up here, and more concepts that apply to evolution, can be applied to meme theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, consider cults that train people to feel like brothers, and then sacrifice themselves and kill for the cult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group selection section I’ve outlined explains why it’s good for a gene to sacrifice an individual for the right number of relatives. This often creates evolutionary pressure to detect relatives. A number of ways of doing this have been arrived at in different species. They range from innate knowledge, to imprinting, to learning. Humans use a mixture of different approaches. This makes humans malleable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The army takes advantage of this. And cults do too. If you can teach people that someone who isn’t their sibling is in fact their sibling, or should be viewed in the same way, you can leverage pre-existing functionality in humans that can even make them harm themselves. This is analogous to the way I’ve described how parasites can work when it comes to biological evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that meme theory also gives a good explanation of how religion started off and got to where it is today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Religion takes advantage of pre-existing infrastructure too. Human brains are fallible. Brains consume a lot of energy. And they often need to make choices with incomplete information. The way they prefer certain choices is biased. There are game theoretic reasons for this. If a human believes a sound is a tiger or some other creature, they are less likely to be killed. Even if it’s just the wind. On the other hand, if they decide to wait and investigate, they are more likely to become tiger food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you combine this with the ability to detect faces and agency, then you end up with superstition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you combine that with early human history, where humans were subject to many forces that they were not aware of, you can end up with humans describing these forces as agents. Eventually these agents become more and more detailed, as people build up the lore over generations. Even now people personify storms, so I don’t think it’s a stretch for people to do so when they did not have a scientific understanding of how the weather works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people would die it looked like a personality disappeared with seemingly no physical change, and in many societies the dead are considered to be spirits who can impact the living and can be appeased or angry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It becomes convenient for people who want power over others to assert that they have a direct line to these powerful agents. And therefore the religions start to apply to all aspects of life. The religions that are best able to make people spread them (through the means that I mentioned earlier — indoctrination, lots of children, and proselytising) become more prominent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because modern communication and transport methods were not present then, these primitive religions have limited competition. Eventually, the popularity reaches a critical mass, and it becomes possible for large scale social policy designed to maximise the spread of the religion - such as punishing blasphemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the stakes are so high, people took it more seriously than they would take other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But unless people forget everything from previous generations and make absolutely no new discoveries, technology advances over time. One area of technology that has improved is faster transportation and advanced communication. This put people of other religions in contact more frequently. And after they stopped killing each other as much, religion had weakened it’s stranglehold over society, because they had to tone it down to live together. And they were also exposed to more different ideas, which weakened the perceived plausibility of their religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Religions began to merge, as people copied appealing parts of other religions to make them more attractive. As scientific understanding increased, the number of forces that supernatural entities were used to explain decreased. At the same time, however, the “size” of the known world increased as knowledge about the world increased. As a result these supernatural entities became more and more powerful. This marks the transition from polytheism to mono-theism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As science and technology advanced even further, the Enlightenment happened. At this point God had very few responsibilities. Many things claimed in religious scripture were contradicted by science, and religion was not as powerful as it used to be so it could not simply censor them. As a result theistic doctrines evolved to remain plausible. Everything that contradicted science became a metaphor! Never mind that people who devoted their lives to studying the scripture prior to the scientific discoveries never came to that conclusion. Instead of being a provincial God, now we have a domino pusher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Enlightenment meant that new memes faced a positive selection pressure for following good epistemology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern religions are very different from how they were even a few hundred years ago. And although superstition still exists, it is not the same as religion. The conditions of widespread ignorance of the things that surround us that helped religion take root no longer do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most religious believers are raised into it rather than converts. And the number of people leaving religion is increasing. Even as religion is being watered down for modern sensibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this memetic analysis of how religion began and developed as a response to a changing environment is a far more sober analysis than “humans that believe in the supernatural are better off”. It allows us to rationally evaluate religious edicts for positive and negative effects rather than blindly assuming that is must be socially good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not writing this to pick on religion. But writing about memes without mentioning religion is like writing about 20th Century European history without mentioning the World Wars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-should-we-approach-institutions&quot;&gt;How should we approach institutions?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rationally. We should try to find the causal mechanisms that underlie various institutions when it comes to deciding whether to keep them. We should look for historical precedence. We should keep an eye out for features of culture that seem to harm people but aid their own spreading.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Philosopher's Apprentance (Guest Writer)</name></author><summary type="html">Introduction</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Consequentialist Component of My Ethical System</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2021/09/07/foo.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Consequentialist Component of My Ethical System" /><published>2021-09-07T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-09-07T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2021/09/07/foo</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2021/09/07/foo.html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this essay, I’m going to discuss the consequentialist component of &lt;a href=&quot;https://tbdp-web.github.io/blog/about/#ethics&quot;&gt;my ethical system&lt;/a&gt;, which has heretofore been neglected quite significantly. I discuss it a little bit in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9O-GLBpBuQ&amp;amp;list=PLEnOSwPSqPCG9XWpcXXvW_5sR0H8SW1CQ&amp;amp;index=3&amp;amp;t=4699s&quot;&gt;recent Crunchy Thoughts podcast&lt;/a&gt;, which I highly recommend you listen to for some context on what prompted this essay and some criticisms of my view on the part of one of my co-hosts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-categories-of-experience&quot;&gt;The Categories of Experience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the core problems of epistemology, as brought into high relief by the problem of hard solipsism, is the fact that human beings have no direct, unmediated connection to reality external to them. Instead, all interaction we have with reality is mediated by our (situated) experiences. One of the core insights of my ethical philosophy, I believe, is that just as epistemology is the first barrier that good metaphysics must pass — a metaphysics that we would have no way of establishing the truth of outside of speculation and assertion is completely useless — it is likewise the first barrier that ethics must pass. Ethics must take into account the situatedness and experiential nature of human existence and therefore natural human valuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This requirement is made more acute by the fact that there are no objective values external to the minds of moral actors, because valuation is a necessarily mental and choice-based concept which makes no ontological sense separated from minds.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; If there are only subjective values, there is no need to attempt to build an objective axiological picture of the reality mediated by our experiences and form unbiased valuations about it in order to pursue an objective standard; instead, we can focus on examining how we actually value experiences relative to each other with no commitment to the complete objectivity of such valuation. Thus, as we shall see, if we accept subjective value, there is nothing wrong with valuing the well-being of those closer to us more than those we barely know of or interact with.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four fundamental categories of experience, as far as I am able to discern:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;simple experiences&lt;/strong&gt;: immediate sensory experience, generally with little to no reference to something outside of the experience itself and the body that experiences it. For example: being burned.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;action experiences&lt;/strong&gt;: immediate introspective experience of deciding how to do something, choosing to do it, considering the action, and so on. For example: writing. Usually accompanied necessarily by simple experiences.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;narrative experiences&lt;/strong&gt;: mediated introspective experience of looking back at previous experiences of all kinds and generating a narrative about the self from them. For example: realizing that one has been a hypocrite.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;state of the world experiences&lt;/strong&gt;: mediated sensory experience, with reference to something external to the experience itself and the experiencer. For example: watching a person get mugged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optimizing the first kind of experience, the simple experiences, can be done by simple pleasure/pain egoism, while the second and third types of experiences, concerning action and narrative identity, can be optimized by virtue ethical egoism. I have formerly focused almost exclusively on the second type of egoism, although it is only a subset of the total system I am working on, because action and narrative experiences are probably both the least obvious/most difficult to optimize and also the most potent. However, I think it is time for me to focus, at least for a time, on the third kind of experience, state of the world experiences. Of course, seeking to optimize states of the world, even if mediated by situated experience, is a consequentialist sort of concern, so consequentialism is the component of egoism which is concerned with dealing with the fourth type of experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-ways-that-state-of-the-world-experiences-influence-us&quot;&gt;The Ways That State of the World Experiences Influence Us&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three innate (but subjective) values that human beings have&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; with regards to states of the world as mediated by experience: (1) well-being, (2) fairness/justice, and (3) aesthetics. The first is generated by our capacity for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/neuroscience-empathy&quot;&gt;empathy&lt;/a&gt;, which forces us to feel secondhand the fulfillment or unfulfillment (happiness or despair) of others, even if we have not even met them directly. The second is generated by our &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797611422072&quot;&gt;innate sense of fairness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01017/full&quot;&gt;justice&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn is generated by our capacity for universalization and rationality when applied to our own personal sense of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/are-humans-hardwired-for-fairness.html&quot;&gt;anger when we are treated unfairly&lt;/a&gt;. The third is generated by a natural desire to live in a world where things are generally &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2020/how-environmental-quality-affects-our-happiness/#how-the-natural-environment-shapes-our-happiness-evidence-from-around-the-world&quot;&gt;healthy&lt;/a&gt; and flourishing and sensible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we have an experience that is “about” the world, we assess the state of the world indicated by that experience, and then we weigh the value — and therefore the effect on our happiness — of that state of the world along these three dimensions. The relative weighting of these dimensions probably differs among humans, but I would venture an educated guess that all three of these aspects are present for all people and none is naturally weighted far out of proportion with the others. People can be convinced to not care about one or the other or all of these, such as when people adopt utilitarianism or deontology and so on, but they will generally bend and stretch their ethical frameworks, or even make exceptions to them, to maintain these values. This is why various ethical hypotheticals such as the trolley problem or the repugnant conclusion are issues for philosophers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;relativistic-consequentialism&quot;&gt;Relativistic Consequentialism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that there are three dimensions along which we value states of the world, and that we value &lt;em&gt;experiences with reference to states of the world&lt;/em&gt; instead of states of the world directly, the kind of consequentialism endorsed by my analysis is quite different from classical utilitarianism of most stripes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the amount that we care about some component of the state of the world (a state &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; the world, if you will) will vary directly according to the frequency and intensity of the experiences we have that indicate that that state in the world exists&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. For example, I will generally care about people I know and people in my local community more about a random community in Africa which I heard about in the news, because I have much more frequent, and much more intense and meaningful, interactions with the people in my community and the people I know. This does not preclude caring, even deeply caring, about the plight of people in Africa, but it does show that it is proper and understandable to be more concerned about people with whom you have actual interactions and relationships more than about those with whom you do not. Utilitarians will try to deny this, but to the degree that they do, they will find that acting on that will cause them to be much less happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, since our concern about fairness and well-being is based on a person-to-person connection (universalization and empathy respectively), we should primarily be concerned with the welfare of actual human beings, instead of welfare &lt;em&gt;simpliciter&lt;/em&gt;. We are concerned with human beings and how they feel, not experience detached from the experiencer and reified into an abstract sum&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; therefore, when comparing the (well-being) value of two states of the world, we should take the sum total of the experiences of each person and then average those sums, instead of taking the sum of all of the experiences of every person&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. For example, suppose I meet a very happy person, and then a person who is quite grumpy. Still on net happy, but barely. Am I going to value this experience of the state of the world more than an experience where I meet only the very happy person? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bmj.com/content/337/bmj.a2338&quot;&gt;No I will not&lt;/a&gt;, even though I experienced more total happiness in the former scenario than in the latter. Likewise, on a larger scale, I would much rather live in a country with a lower population and a much higher average happiness, so that everyone around me is happy and productive, even if there aren’t that many of them, rather than a country with a much higher population but where everyone is much less happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, there is the fact that there are multiple dimensions to the optimization that my kind of consequentialism has to do. Instead of just optimizing for well-being, it also has to take into account justice/fairness and aesthetic value as well. Although to some degree those latter two might be double-counted into the first one, they must be optimized for their own sake as well, as well-being doesn’t really get a privilege over fairness for instance when it comes to how people innately value states of the world relative to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My ethical system, then, which focuses on an optimization of fulfilling and rewarding experiences, necessarily entails a certain specific form of consequentialism. It is, of course, just one component among many others (deontological, virtue ethical, and simply material) that must all be optimized, but it is nevertheless an important thing to take note of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Declaring that there is no such thing as objective value right at the beginning of an essay on ethical philosophy might seem like a strange thing to do. However, even though all values are necessarily subjective, that does not preclude them from being innate and immutable to the person or species; it also does not prevent people from being mistaken as to what their core values are (you see people desperately seeking something that they think will make them happy, but actually won’t, all the time), nor does it prevent them from being mistaken concerning what values can be derived from those core values, how they should all be weighed and systematized, or how they should best be pursued. The task of ethical philosophy, in my view, is to do those things for people. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There are actually important requirements on our valuations, generated by virtue ethical concerns. These are not included under the consequentialist heading, however. Additionally, it should be pointed out that bigotry, for instance, is an artificial and actively irrational practice, whereas caring less about people who are far away is a natural and largely arational thing: while bigotry is an explicit rejection of an obvious fact (the shared humanity of another human being) and an artifical attempt to generate hatred for them, whereas caring less about people who are far away is not ignoring something that’s there for artificial reasons, but simply not going out of your way to attempt to modify your value system. There is more here to discuss, but this is not the time. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:7&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I am going to speak in generalities about human valuation here, and I think that is valid for several reasons. First of all, it is necessary that humans &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; in values in the first place, otherwise we wouldn’t survive as a species. Second, they need to have propositional content to a certain degree because we don’t operate primarily on instincts. Third, they are determined by neurochemical and biological structures, as they need to be to be a pre-cognitive and evolutionarily selectable thing, and the biological variance between individual Homo sapiens is very low, which indicates that it is unlikely for such an extensive system to be completely different in most individuals, as something like a large portion of that biodiversity would have to go into the genes for neurochemistry to make a big change. The probability being low would mean only a small percentage of humans have a totally different built in value system, which is what we see with psychopaths. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:7&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;An objection to this is that a way to optimize positive experiences of states of the world could then be to simply lock oneself away in a private community and avoid knowledge of anything bad happening outside. There are two problems with this, however. First, preventing oneself from being aware of, or feeling the impact of, the suffering of those around you, comes at the cost of your freedom, intellectual integrity, curiosity, and so on, and generally speaking that cost isn’t really worth it. Second, most people actually won’t find this to be a satisfying option. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is a move that utilitarians make which is confusing to me in the extreme, since they seem to care more about pleasure than the experience of pleasure or the beings experiencing it, which verges on the nonsensical because pleasure means nothing without something to experience it. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This makes the solution to the repugnant conclusion obvious, since I would much rather live in a world with a lower population but higher average happiness, to a world with a gigantic population but where everyone is just barely happier than not. Of course, the natural objection is that by doing this, I have opened myself up to the reverse of the repugnant conclusion, which is valuing a world in which there is one, or a very small number, of extremely happy people. However, I simply don’t see this as a very problematic view at all, since the amount of people you would need to have a very high average level of happiness is probably substantial anyway, and other considerations would prevent using mass murder as a way to achieve this. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:5&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;An example that one of my friends suggested explains this in terms of grades at school. Schools, like my kinds of consequentialists, want to optimize the average grade of their students, because their focus is on having &lt;em&gt;the students&lt;/em&gt; do well. They are focused on actually extant concreta. Schools don’t focus on maximizing the total sum of all the grades, because then they could make the classes bigger and bigger and ignore how well the students are actually doing, because they’re focused on optimizing for an abstraction that is removed from its proper context (a grade removed from a student doesn’t really mean anything, and a grade sum even less). &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:6&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, setting priors in the context of a philosophical discussion is going to be far less of an exact science and far more of a heuristic than in the context of true statistical analysis. As such, the way I recommend you view this guide is more as a list of things to remember to check when deciding on the prior probability / plausibility of a certain hypothesis, as well as a way to conceptualize how they should be weighted relative to each other. In a similar way, when assessing the likelihood of a given piece of evidence given a certain hypothesis, and if philosophical discussion one cannot come up with the exact probabilities in the way that you can in a statistical analysis, but you can roughly speaking estimate the relative size of the probability in comparison to the size of the prior probability. All that’s important here is whether the probability of the evidence given a certain hypothesis overcomes the prior implausibility of the hypothesis itself, which is a relative judgment and not an absolute one. Of course, having concrete numbers would be very useful to determine what your posterior probability is, but you can’t have everything. Again, think of Bayesian reasoning as a whole, not just my list of things that you should use when considering your priors, as more of a heuristic that reminds you to consider all facets of a certain hypothesis, instead of only considering the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis, which people often do and which is a noted cognitive bias in human beings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what is this list? Here it is, in order of relative weight:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Metaphysical burden or price tag: the more new types of objects one must introduce in order to construct one hypothesis, the less likely It is that the hypothesis will be correct as far as your priors are concerned. By types of objects, I mean new ontological or metaphysical types with different laws and behaviors: New types of matter, for instance, or even things that are not matter at all such as the supernatural. Note that the less demonstrated this new type of thing is, or the more different it is from types of things that have been demonstrated to exist in the past, the greater the burden of the individual type will be as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Propositional complexity: since the probability of the conjunction of two propositions being true Is less than the probability of either of the two propositions alone being true, the more propositions one must put in conjunction together in order to construct and describe your hypothesis, the less intrinsically likely it is that your hypothesis is correct. Note that this can be overcome if the propositions one is conjugating our inherently themselves very likely, such that a very long chain of extremely likely a propositions may be just as inherently plausible as a very short chain of incredibly unlikely propositions, we’re likelihood is determined of course by the amount of demonstrations we have of either that proposition being true or, alternatively, but less effectively, similar propositions being true. Also note that propositions that are derived from other propositions do not count when analyzing propositional complexity, as their inherent probability is not unique and so to include them in the probability of the conjunction overall would be to double count, as it would essentially be counting the probability of the propositions that this new proposition is derived from twice, once for the original propositions and once for the derived one. Thus a hypothesis that has very few basic propositions that describe it, but the propositions of which are very fertile and can lead to a lot of results should not be penalized for this. In fact, hypotheses like these, when the derived propositions are actually descriptive of evidence, should be vastly preferred.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Post Hocness: The more a hypothesis is arbitrarily fitted to a set of evidence, less likely it is that that hypothesis will actually be predictive for further events, as it will become more and more overfitted to one particular event. Furthermore, oftentimes when this overfitting occurs, it leads to a hypothesis where the underlying causal mechanism posited in order to explain the events falls to the wayside and is only paid lip service to, while most of the evidence is simply positive as brute facts somewhat related to this under explained underlying mechanism, whereas the entire point of building hypotheses in order to figure out what the best explanation is for a set of data is in order to come up with a set of robust causal mechanisms underneath the evidence we have in order to understand how things will happen going forward and be able to interact with them. Additionally, this is extremely likely to happen when what we are talking about and trying to build a hypothesis about is a single event that will only happen one time and of which there are no other similar events known to us either, such as the beginning of the universe; hence hypotheses that are designed to explain a singular event of which there are no similar events known to us should be viewed with higher suspicion and higher intrinsic improbability.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Expected evidence: This is a criteria that may not belong on this list, as if you count a lack of evidence as a form of evidence you can instead use instances of a lack of evidence as evidence that is more or less likely under a given hypothesis and use it directly in the theorem instead of putting in the priors, but that seems like a very odd thing to do, so I’ll include this as something you should think about for your priors instead. Essentially, if a given hypothesis leaves you to expect their to be evidence in certain areas or in certain ways, especially if it leads you to expect a lot of very prominent and easily accessible evidence, and that evidence cannot be found, then that means that the hypothesis has a pretty high intrinsic improbability, because it had very many chances to provide evidence that would have raised its posterior probability but did not do so. How you calculate the amount of chances it had versus the amount of times that an event happened that was slightly more probable given that hypothesis instead of another one is pretty much up to you, and I would be extremely careful using this criteria heavily when deciding your priors, as depending on how you could do it it could have a disproportionate effect. Furthermore depending on the hypothesis, this can become a very important criteria.&lt;/li&gt;

However, I’m going to make this short voice dictated article on it just because I had originally intended to make another article, but forgotten the topic on which I’d wanted to do it, but still have the desire to make an article, and this topic is as good as any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topic of this article will be the purpose of philosophy. This has, essentially, two very closely interlinked components that need answering under its heading: First, what subjects philosophy should cover and the extent to which it should cover them, and second, why human beings do philosophy in the first place. The second must of course be answered in light of the first, but likewise the first must in some sense be answered as part of the second, because if we do not know what philosophy covers, then it is difficult to explain why we do it, and if we do not know why we do philosophy and at least some capacity, then it is difficult to explain what it should cover. As such I’ll essentially answer these two questions as a single question, as the explanation will be deeply interlinked, but please keep in mind that there are two separate questions at play here, even if they must be answered in an intermingled fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I see it, the fundamental reason that human beings do philosophy is in order to clarify our understanding of ourselves and the world. If we have a perfect intuitive understanding of the world, or, alternatively, if it did not matter to us whether we understood the world or not, either because we had no choice in our understanding and could not expand it, or no choice in our actions and so could not act on the basis of our understanding, or because reality somehow did not punish us for acting on the basis of wrong understandings, then of course philosophy would not be particularly interesting. However, it is the case that we can be mistaken on first approximation in our understanding of almost everything about the world, even the things that seem most obvious and intuitive to us. Although our intuitions can lend us some guidance, acting as a pointer and springboard for further investigation, our intuitions are quite often wrong. Likewise, not only can our first approximation of understanding via intuition and simple observation be mistaken, but there is a penalty for being mistaken, as beliefs inform actions and actions have consequences both to ourselves and others. Of course, beliefs have varying degrees of consequences — some beliefs do not present a very large risk to us if they turn out to be wrong, while others prevent a very great risk indeed — but all incorrect beliefs have some sort of consequence. Even beliefs that could not possibly inform direct action, such perhaps as beliefs concerning the nature of mathematics, can inform other beliefs or prevent forming other beliefs which might be correct and might lead to more accurate forms of action down the road. Alternatively, beliefs that have absolutely no connection to action in any fashion whatsoever, if they exist as I am not altogether sure that they do, form an unnecessary burden on our thinking and in that sense half a penalty themselves as well. Thus, we are fallible, and our fallibility has tangible impact on us. This is where philosophy comes in. Philosophy, as the love of wisdom, is the investigation of truth. It is the attempt to form more accurate beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, in a sense, the foundation of philosophy is epistemology, if we can understand what it means for I believe to be true or accurate, and how we should go about forming these beliefs, then most of the work of philosophy is done. We have arrived at a system that guides us to correct beliefs, and as such, we have in a sense achieved what we care about. Furthermore, if we do not understand what it means for a belief to be true or accurate, and we do not understand how to arrive at true or accurate beliefs, then of course no philosophy or anything else can proceed in anything like a useful fashion, as we are groping around blind in the dark. However, although the most important task of philosophy is perhaps epistemology, it’s job does not end there. After all, once we have an epistemology, we must then set ourselves the task of actually using the system that we have developed in order to arrive at accurate beliefs. This of course requires observations and empirical testing and confirming with others and other things that we would consider part of science, and not philosophy, but it also includes things that are necessarily philosophical and not empirical, such as conceptual clarification, the working out of the implications of empirical observations, and the selection of the most accurate interpretations of those empirical observations and the construction of theories in order to explain and predict them. All of these things, since they primarily use the mind and involve reason and similar faculties over empiricism, could more accurately be termed philosophy. However, if philosophy is the love of wisdom, there is a sense in which science should be categorized under philosophy. After all, science, like these other secondary applications of philosophy, is merely the application of epistemology in order to arrive at true beliefs, which is what these other secondary fields of philosophy are doing as well, just with less of a focus on empirical data. This is why I actually like the designation of science as natural philosophy: If the purpose and interest in philosophy is arriving at true beliefs and the fundamental task of philosophy is epistemology first and foremost, as is hinted at by the definition of philosophy as the love of wisdom, then anything that is the systematic attempt to arrive at true beliefs using epistemology as determined by more basic philosophy should be categorized as philosophy as well, and this includes science. Of course, The methods unique to science are quite different than the methods of philosophy used in other fields of philosophy and in the activity of science surrounding those unique methods, and so it is equally as valid, especially when stressing these differences, to view philosophy and science as separate, with the core of the separation being that while science has a particular focus on peer review and empirical observation, philosophy has more of a focus on linguistics, conceptual clarification, the analysis of the implications and definitions and relations of concepts, and other more rationalistic endeavors. Both are equally necessary, extremely so, but there is a duality here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is more to philosophy than this. Four, there are some areas that are simply extremely difficult to explore with empirical observation and the scientific method (insofar as science can be said to have a method). These generally include areas that have to do with the human mind, since as of yet the human mind is far too complex to understand by pure empirical observation, And is better understood by a compliment of empirical observation through psychology and neurology and philosophy through introspection and analysis. Perhaps in the future, as has happened with many other fields that were formally the soul domain of philosophy, science will find the tools and conceptual resources to subsume this, but I find this unlikely due to the complexity. Thus I would include under the heading of philosophy and its domain such things as ethics, which is the attempt to uncover the most basic and necessary values that human beings share and to understand the implication of those values on the general rules that we use to determine what is permissible and information in our actions, and political philosophy both as an extension of ethics and an extension of sociology, and even sociology itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also like to point out that I think in modern science there is, at least in the humanities such as psychology and social science, a dearth of accurate conceptual analysis and philosophical reasoning. Four, it should be noted that since philosophies domain has most often included a rationalistic investigation of the realities that we must deal with, it has constructed a very robust set of tools for understanding the implications of evidence and argument, the proper structures of argument, and how to do conceptual analysis. The harder sciences which can rely more heavily on purely empirical and predictive methods have less use for these philosophical tools, but ironically the science is which have the least opportunity to rely to heavily on empiricism are the ones that often forget most profoundly the tools that philosophy offers them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s in essence I see the purpose of philosophy as helping us understand how to form correct beliefs, and what correct even means, and then also, through its subdomains, the actual working out and practical use of these tools of understanding and coming to correct conclusions. Thus there is a sense in which science remains natural philosophy, a subfield of philosophy dedicated to using the tools of epistemology that philosophy provides in empiricism and such to arrive at correct beliefs about the external world, but also a sense in which it is a separate discipline, as the majority of past philosophy was overwhelmingly rationalistic, and so we can define philosophy as limited to those rationalistic aims, perhaps working out the implications of empirical conclusions, and science as a separate discipline focusing on empiricism. However, once again it should be stress that empiricism ultimately comes from philosophy and science has the same goals as philosophy, so I think it is valid to view science as a form of philosophy. Those who stress the difference, or even condemn philosophy, have misapprehended the nature of science and its origins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, none of this is to suggest, as many of the apologists, theologians, and common people of faith who scream scientism constantly do, that empiricism is just as valid as rationalism or subjectivism, or even less so, in the process of understanding the external world. Nor do I attempt to say that empiricism is subordinate to rationalism. Far from it. Rationalism, the application of reason to conceptual analysis and the study of arguments and implications, gains its validity and its usefulness from the prior work of the foundations of epistemology, which is the same place that empiricism itself gains its validity and usefulness from. It is true that this foundational epistemology is itself derived from reason and introspection, things commonly thought of as rationalistic, but that reason itself explains why, in all other domains, rationalism and empiricism should be placed on the same footing, and also confined to different domains of usefulness. Rationalism should not be used to determine truths about the external world purely, but as a help to empiricism in working out its implications. Likewise, empiricism cannot coherently be used to work out conceptual implications, and neither can it be used to understand epistemology and truths about what we are thinking and so on, since empiricism itself is not empirically demonstrable, nor are my own internal thoughts and reasonings empirically to demonstrable. Empiricism, since it is based on the senses which are linked to the external world, is of primary use for understanding the external world, and rationalism, since it is primarily linked to our internal minds, our best for understanding our internal minds, including how we should arrive at truth. They can of course overlap, as we can use our minds in order to parse out the information that observation gives us, but they have unique and separate domains.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alexis</name></author><summary type="html">I recently began a discussion with one of my friends in our Discord server which we agreed to finish in our upcoming philosophy meeting this week, as we intend to begin that tradition again now that I’ve recovered from a recent setback and I’m feeling study again.

I have a pretty terrible headache today, and I’m just bored as fuck and I’ve been thinking about this subject for quite a while so here it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really don’t think debates are a good way to go about doing things. My main issue with debates is the time limit: it prevents a detailed and nuanced exploration of the subject, as 1 to 3 hours is simply not enough time to actually go in depth on any philosophical or scientific topic, and worse, it actually changes the nature of the dialogue from being about which side has the best arguments or the most professional and academic literature on its side, to which side has the most adept orators and who has the most responses memorized off the cuff. Because the thing is, if you have a limited amount of time to respond to something someone has said, it becomes extremely easy for them to gish gallop, or simply be so wrong that it would take way too long to unpack the way in which they’re wrong. Furthermore, if you have a limited amount of time, it can be difficult to fully explain or even formulate a response to something someone has said if one doesn’t have an off-the-cuff response memorized already, which is difficult to do for actually correct arguments. Additionally, it can happen, because you don’t have time to do research in order to respond to what someone has said, that one can simply happen to not be familiar with the necessary part of the literature in order to be able to respond to someone has said, even if what they have said is manifestly wrong and demonstrally so if you were familiar with the literature. And so what ends up happening is a debate does not actually demonstrate which side has the best arguments, which side is correct, which side has all the professional or academic literature on it side, or any of these other useful things to demonstrate. Instead, it demonstrates which side has the best pre-memorized responses and which side has the smoothest and sharpest orators. This is why I think debates are probably best for some form of entertainment, but not much else. Debates don’t indicate which side is actually more likely to be correct, or even which orator really knows more or is smarter or is more correct, instead they just indicate who is quickest on their feet and who have something memorized. This is especially true since oftentimes in a debate, even an incorrect answer, if said smoothly glibly and confidently enough, can sound like enough of a response or rebuttal, and it’s often quite easy to memorize simple but wrong answers. Indeed, I think it is a general truth in philosophy that a good accurate and nuanced argument is going to be far longer than a wrong argument. There are long wrong arguments, but there are almost no short right arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the thing about debates is that the idea is not to change the other person’s mind or to arrive at a more nuanced understanding of the problem, the point of the debate to win. And generally, as I alluded to above, it is enough to be considered to have one to have a simple, understandable, and preferably funny retort or rebuttal to a comment someone has made. It needs to have perhaps the appearance of rightness, or something analogous to writing anyway, but it does not need to actually be right. Therefore, combining this with the time limit that prevents someone from making an in-depth critique of a statement that is so wrong it verges on nonsense but sounds reasonable and would take a very long time to unpack, I generally happens that in debates, those who have a large amount of rote and trite answers, generally incorrect ones, and who are able to spout them with enough confidence, are generally viewed to be correct by those who already agree with them and also those who are undecided, and only those who already vehemently disagree with them will be able to realize that they remain wrong. And since the point of the debate is to win, this doesn’t seem problematic to those who have participated in, or listened to, the debate. Meanwhile, if the point of the debate was explicitly to change the other person’s mind, or to deepen and enrich the ideas in both people’s minds, then it would become clear that the trite and scathing answer, that is delivered with a plum and clearly pre-memorized, is not what is desired, and would be quickly thrown out even if it has the appearance of correctness, because it is far too trite. However, this is unfortunately not the case, as debates have become a forearm for middle brow people to enjoy feeling smart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong. I don’t particularly have anything against debates in the sense that I don’t think they should be stopped. The beach are still useful in a few ways beyond just as entertainment. For one thing, debates can introduce you to people who might have more in-depth and nuanced and interesting works for you to explore on your own time; this is especially useful since the debate will introduce you to thinkers of opposing views, such that if you want to go deeper into the subject, you’ll then be aware of people of differing views who have deeper works on the subject, instead of simply sticking with the intellectual tradition that you were already familiar with or leaning towards. Additionally, debates can serve as surface level introductions to a topic in order to peak your interest in further investigation, although the danger with this is that if one side appears to have soundly one the debate, you can go away thinking you don’t need to look any further, or thinking that you will only need to investigate the side that one, which due to the non-truthy nature of debates, might be a serious mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do I propose instead of live debates? This is a difficult question, as debates seem to have been the accepted form of public discourse for a very very long time. However, I think there is something to be said for the old tradition of writing letters back and forth in response to people, as people used to do responding to each other in newspapers and such. Of course, nowadays it seems too much to ask to ask people to read extended debates in text, so the closest approximation for today’s world would probably be YouTube response videos: people can trade back and forth videos that are completely under their control and that they have enough time to research and study and formulate their arguments for, therefore leading to something that is a debate in that it’s multi-sided and people are arguing with each other and expressing different views, but it is more likely to reflect accurately the truth of the matter and the consensus of wherever scholars study the matter under debate.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alexis</name></author><summary type="html">Hello everyone and today you guys are going to be in for another irregularly posted angry rant about something random on this blog.
