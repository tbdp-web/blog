The first important effect of taking a new perspective with regard to anarchism, like the general perspective I described in [the introduction to this series](/2022/07/25/process.html) is changing one&apos;s understanding of the proper methods for achieving it. After all, one of the most important aspects of anarchism is that its methods prefigure its goals --- anarchist organizing is an exercise in practice and demonstration, showing why a world without authority is possible by demonstrating that things can be achieved without it, through horizontal means. Thus, when one&apos;s understanding of anarchism changes, so, too, must one&apos;s understanding of how to go about _achieving_ anarchism! Thus, once you start seeing anarchism as an ongoing process of learning, adaptation, and experimentation, responsive to local conditions and particular needs, instead of a project of social planning, you will quickly start to see why an insurrection, not a revolution, is what is needed.

## Why Revolutionaries Become Reactionaries

What is the difference between an insurrection and a revolution? The first hint is contained within the words themselves: a revolution aims at just exactly what it sounds like --- revolving the wheel of history and society, exchanging the current unsatisfactory order for a new, different one. The aim is therefore not just to overthrow the hierarchy and domination of the current order, but to establish some new state of affairs.

Because of this, revolution requires a unified intent. Since it wants to establish a new thing in place of the old, instead of just overthrowing the old hierarchies in order to make space for whatever arrangements the individual will finds pleasing, with the same scope and generality, over mostly the same people, it requires centralized organization, in order to make the intellectual and physical enforcement that it needs possible. Everyone must be thus unified because if different ideas of what must be established in place of the old system are allowed to grow and flourish, then the revolution will inevitably devolve into warring factions, each looking to establish rulership over all --- exactly the sort of thing we typically see in the &quot;power vacuum&quot; supposedly left behind by the collapse of states, which really only exists because there still remains the possibility, and expectation, that someone _must_ rule.

Moreover, it is always the most fervent revolutionaries that become the staunchest reactionaries --- after the revolution. As Novatore says,

 &gt; every form of society, born from the fragments of the old one that fell resoundingly into the void, has the conviction that it is the only perfect one. And it is precisely this dogma of perfection that drives [it] to be so utterly reactionary toward the restless Rebel who does not at all intend to bow before the new God... wouldn’t a very large portion of those who pretend to be furiously revolutionary today, themselves be the fiercest reactionary conservatives of tomorrow? --- Renzo Novatore, [_Cry of Rebellion_](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/renzo-novatore-cry-of-rebellion)

This follows clearly from the nature of revolution itself: in order to become a revolutionary, you must have a social plan or set of institutions you wish to establish; for that, you must become confident in the perfection of your system, comfortable in the knowledge of its eternal capacity to fulfill the needs of all people, or its supremacy over needs. Thus you must become blinded to other valid ways of organizing social forces anarchistically, deafened to the needs and interests of people --- in other words, possessed by a fixed idea of what society must look like. Once this end-state is achieved, you inevitably become reactionary, dead set against any change, because your perfect idea of society has been achieved at last! To allow it to change now would be to have it move away from your social plan, your desired end-state for society, and thus would be as bad as letting the revolution go to waste, to fail, and you cannot allow that to happen. Thus, you must protect it against change at all costs, just as smug in your assurance that this social arrangement must be the right one as the capitalist apologists are today. This prevents society from changing to suit the needs the individuals within it, from adapting to the shifting conditions its members find themselves in, and from taking advantage of the increasing knowledge that can be gained through the continuous experimentation and revision of social norms.

Thus, both before and after &quot;the revolution,&quot; a revolutionary mindset creates subjugation to an idea: it must introduce a hierarchy of thought, an incorporeal rulership over the individual will, which in turn often leads to a very corporeal sort of rulership, with the accompanying need for both intellectual and physical enforcement to ensure that everyone stays in line. &quot;The revolution was not directed against _the existent_, but against _this existent_, against a _particular_ existence.&quot; Therefore, revolutionary anarchism is internally inconsistent, at odds with itself, as its means lead to exactly the opposite of the ends which it wishes to achieve. It inevitably leads to an inflexible, suspicious, conservative society which does not allow any change or experimentation, any learning. This is why prefigurative politics, the application of properly and truly anarchist _means_ in the struggle for anarchism against capitalism and the state is so crucially important.

In contrast, an insurrection is merely the destruction of the old order, the elimination of hierarchy and domination through direct action, sabotage, asymmetrical warfare, resistance, strike, self-defense and community defense, all done in solidarity or individually, with no need for a central thrust or organization. Its purpose is to fertilize the fields of society with its blood and tears so that a million individual arrangements can flourish and grow, not planned, nor ruled by any system. To quote Stirner, &quot;the revolution is aimed at new arrangements, while the insurrection leads us to no longer let ourselves be arranged, but rather to arrange ourselves.&quot; Thus, while revolution creates absolutism and the struggle for power through the assumption that a new system must be put in place, insurrection does away with all that. Insurrectionary anarchism has none of the internal contradictions that revolutionary anarchism has, and thus, especially in light of the idea that justice arises from the proper conditions, not out of particular formulas or outcomes, it is obvious that insurrectionary means are the only proper way to achieve anarchist ends.

In the next essay in this series, [&quot;Tacit Knowledge, Local Conditions, and Social Planning&quot;](/2022/07/27/process2.html), I will expand on these ideas concerning social planning, and explain how, when trying to create a social plan that is actually in the interests of all of the people who will be under it, that will encompass all of the needs of society, you are ultimately forced to give up a plan with specific norms and institutions, and adopt a general social theory instead, which specifies the conditions for the development of norms and institutions, instead of the norms and institutions themselves.</content><author><name>Alexis Purslane</name></author><category term="anarchism" /><summary type="html">Anarchist individualism as we understand it – and I say we because a substantial handful of friends think this like me – is hostile to every school and every party, every churchly and dogmatic moral, as well as every more or less academic imbecility.

If we are to maintain that anarchy is not a social plan, but the conditions for a society that is not planned, then we will obviously have to dismiss with social planning as a whole, and this requires a more thorough deconstruction of the problems with it.

First, however, let me clarify what I mean. People who are facing a certain problem getting together and trying to figure out how to fix it is fine; so is theorizing about the various ways different problems could be solved, as long as no one tries to prescribe those theories as the only correct way to do it. Those are not the senses of social planning I mean. Instead, I am referring to the distinct phenomenon of constructing a theoretical set of social norms and institutions, as I&apos;ve been discussing, that one wishes to see uniformly implemented in society, which one believes to be the single correct method of organizing, or even nearly so. This particular bent is what Novatore is referring in the opening epigraph, too, when he says &quot;_Oafs and weaklings!&quot; Like Novatore, if someone presents me with an absolute plan for society which must be followed to the letter, even if it is amenable to my sensibilities and interests, my instinct must always be to &quot;trample it under my sacrilegious feet,&quot; because I refuse to bow, or ask anyone else to bow, to an idea. But it is not only for purely egoistic reasons that social planning is impracticable.

## The Authoritarianism of Social Planning

As I discussed in the section about revolution, such social planning always requires top-down enforcement in the end. Why is that? Everyone has unique and incommensurable life experiences, different situations, a different perspective, set of values, and personal interests. No matter how rational everyone is (if rationality is even to be taken as a necessarily good thing!), we are all ultimately living in our own worlds, our own incommensurate spheres of subjectivity, constructing our understandings of the world using different data and assumptions, our own different standpoints or starting places, and can never completely overcome that, since rationality itself is merely a tool that uncovers what is already contained within its premises. This means that rational disagreement between individuals is not only possible, but inevitable, even if not all perspectives are inherently &quot;equal.&quot; We will inevitably not only arrive at a different understanding of what the costs and benefits of any social system are, but will evaluate even the ones that are agreed upon differently. This is especially true for something like social norms and institutions, which often effect people in very personal and far-reaching, and also very _disparate_, ways, and the evaluation of which often requires detailed and epistemically uncertain speculation about things like sociology, economics, and history.

In the face of this inevitable disagreement, what can a social planner do?

They can attempt to add more and more details and nuance to their plans, opening them up to all sorts of different needs and perspectives, but eventually that will lead to the dissolution of the social plan _as a plan_, relinquishing it into a sort of general social theory, as I am demonstrating right now in my own philosophy. They will eventually realize that no social plan can ever take into account all of the various needs and unique situations, the tacit knowledge and accumulated tradition, the hard-won fruits of continuous experimentation and compromise, that each individual person and community represents. The social institutions that best suit people&apos;s needs are often specific to the local conditions, the situated reality, and no plan can encompass that. It will inexorably become obvious that attempting to include all of that explicitly would be an impossible task, always leaving something to be desired, because the project of creating a social plan, _qua_ plan, is that of abstraction to principles and generalizations, removing details and simplifying categorizations (details and distinctions which might be very important at the local scale) in order to make a comprehensible large scale picture. Thus they will quickly realize that the map is not the territory, and pretending that it is is the road to disaster, and be forced to create a more open theory, with space for personality, adaptation, and experimentation --- thus creating a social theory instead of a social plan. 

Within this theory, it will be easier to rule out what cannot work --- what cannot serve everyone&apos;s interests because it requires domination and hierarchy --- than to outline what exactly _will_, which is exactly what you see in my philosophy and in Neo-Proudhonian theory in general. This is a fundamental insight, I think, and why individual autonomy and the anarchic encounter are the twin keys that I see as the main positive thrust of my anarchism: it is only in clearing the space for individual experimentation and decision-making that it is possible to create a society that is truly free and treats the interests of all equally, meeting everyone&apos;s needs. This is why I like to say that **the way that guides is not the constant way**: anything specific enough to provide meaningful guidance in a particular situation is also specific enough to be no longer applicable somewhere.

The other alternative for the social planner is, of course, to become a reactionary --- to enforce from above the simplified social plan they have in mind, inevitably benefiting some at the cost of others, subjugating everyone to an idea, and creating social distortions and unrest that will eventually bubble up into disobedience which will need to be put down in and endless war against the very people the planner sought to &quot;save&quot; through their plan. Thus it is under the current state, which wages an endless &quot;counter-insurgency&quot; war against its own populace in order to maintain the gross inequalities and power imbalances that have been created as a result of, ultimately, Western Enlightenment and Christian social planning. This enforcement can take the form of social pressure and intolerance, the distributed consequences so necessary to enforcing anything in society being adapted to the task of the suppression of the different, anything that falls outside the lines of the plan; but it will always eventually transform, once the distortions get worse than any possible social censure could be, into outright ongoing violence.

## Conclusion

Thus, the inadequacy of social planning: it cannot deal with disagreement, nor the actual data and needs of people, and because of that, it must either dissolve itself or become violent. It must either say &quot;if it doesn&apos;t work for you, well, too bad!&quot; and give up balancing and meeting everyone&apos;s needs, or even most people&apos;s needs, or it needs to become fluid, malleable, and open.

Wilbur, [_Constructing an Anarchism: Collective Force_](https://www.libertarian-labyrinth.org/workshops/constructing-an-anarchism-collective-force/)

So, given the shortcomings and internal contradictions of a planning, top-down, revolutionary approach to anarchism, what is the alternative? What is this general social theory I have been hinting at? That is what I want to discuss in this essay. Keep in mind that this social theory is not total: it does not encompass all of the forces and processes at work in social life, let alone psychological life. It cannot predict all that occurs in society, and will always be effected and modified by things outside itself. Furthermore, it is not a mathematical or praxeological proof, nor is it meant to be a grand system. It is a theory based on my understanding of the social dynamics of human beings, how they tend to act and react, and what effect that has on everyone else, gleaned from a practical, intuitive process of observation of the world and of history and a synthesis of political theory. This is, in effect, my attempt to describe how I see the world --- take it or leave it. I think it is very correct, perhaps even strikingly so, in broad strokes and particular areas, but if you do not share the same understanding of how humans work than I do, I don&apos;t think its worth wasting the pixels, here at least, to try to provide Absolute Proof that you are right and I am wrong. I do have my reasons, and perhaps you&apos;ll get a sense of them, but attempting to produce absolute proof is a fool&apos;s errand anyway, and giving all the reasons I have would make this essay far too long.

## A General Theory of Social Forces

Let me set the stage first. In [&quot;Justice and the Anarchic Encounter&quot;](https://blog.alexispurslane.xyz/2022/07/10/anarchic-encounter.html), I have already introduced two key concepts of my method of social analysis, the anarchic encounter, and justice-as-balance. The first concept, the _anarchic encounter_, is represents the archetypal meeting between two equals --- equal because they acknowledge no superior master, not equal in any specific material sense ---, two free absolutes or unique ones, who meet on a terrain not shaped by any hierarchy or power-over. The second concept is the natural result of such an encounter, where all out physical conflict is avoided, as it must usually be, since the costs of conflict are steep: _justice-as-balance_, which refers to the balancing of interests in an arrangement, so that just as each person involved in the arrangement is used by the arrangement, so they too also use the arrangement, and each gains equal benefit --- in a sense, the most concrete expression of Kant&apos;s categorical imperative that everyone be treated not _only_ as a means, but _also_ as an end in themselves, by having their interests always satisfied at the same time that others use them to satisfy their own.

Next, in [&quot;Power and Hierarchy&quot;](https://blog.alexispurslane.xyz/2022/07/18/power-and-hierarchy.html), I described a theory of coercion, power-over, and hierarchy, in an attempt to at least partially give a toolkit for identifying those things that is separate from justice-as-balance and the anarchic encounter. In my account, I described a set of definitions where each next concept is at least partially conditioned by the presence of the previous, so that power-over exists where coercion is used to control others,[^1] and hierarchy exists wherever power-over is reified and legitimized. Furthermore, I clarified how one of the most important factors influencing the organization of arrangements in society is precisely the fact that each person has a will to power --- an innate wish to exercise power over themselves and the world around them --- and *actually does* exercise power, even coercion, in that manner.

In order to complete the development of this general social theory, we will need to analyze the nature of the organization of forces in society, since it is those forces which shape the terrain on which the anarchic encounter can or cannot grow, whether the soil of society is barren and hostile or fertile and flowering. We will need to understand what these forces are, how they come about, how they interact, how we can think about them, and, most importantly, why they must be brought into balance in order to create a society ripe with anarchic encounters and ready for the free play of our wills and uniqueness.

### Unity-Collectivities

A unity-collectivity in Proudhon&apos;s social science can be represented as a mesh network of highly interconnected connected, mutually interacting nodes, where each of those nodes does not have to interact with _every_ other node in the network, but generally connects to as many other nodes as possible, and where the connections are multiplied so that generally speaking if you take a path from one node to another, there is always a route back to the first node that does not use the same set of nodes in between, so that the interactions on the mesh network can go in a loop instead of just back and forth. Furthermore, the connections between these nodes will generally be tight and high-bandwidth, meaning that they can foster a lot of communication and mutual resource and information sharing, as well as containing some fluidity by which different actions can be taken with respect to each other depending on the situation, since a highly formalized and rigid connection between two nodes is more distant.

The borders between unity-collectivities, both nested ones and peer-related ones, are often fuzzy, because there can be relations between nodes in two different unity-collectivities, or the same individuals can be part of multiple ones, creating an overlap of connections. Nevertheless, the separateness of these collectivities can be maintained --- and this is clearly the case, &quot;don&apos;t think, just look&quot; --- through the understanding that even the same person can operate in different social capacities, and the fact that connections themselves can be understood to be different in character, with different degrees of closeness in the coupling, and furthermore, the presence or absence of _other_ paths, as I described earlier, can significantly change the character of a connection. 

A collectivity, in this sense, can be anything from a friend group, to a union, to a corporation, to a nation-state --- or even the entire global society! Every unity-collectivity you look at is both technically just a section of a larger one, and technically the composition of smaller ones. 

In the foregoing analysis, I am using the word &apos;node&apos; as a simle way to refer to any type of _social entity_, any being or organization of beings capable of action and interaction in the social world. This includes both individuals and smaller, more tightly interconnected collectivities, which can exist nested within larger ones.

Now, what gives these collectivities their unity? What makes a collectivity a social entity? It is the alignment of the individual forces --- which together constitute the collectivity --- in a single direction, according to a single logic. Thus multiple smaller unities become a larger unity, and the collectivity becomes a social entity in its own right, apart from just the social entities which compose it.

A unity-collectivity becomes more than just that which composes it for two reasons. First, because this unity of the application of forces which compose it gives it much greater force than any of those individual powers alone, which is called _collective force_. Second, because such unity-collectivities often act seemingly with a mind of their own, displaying emergent behavior as a sort of social superorganism, as a result of the intense feedback between the intra-network interplay of reasoning and decisions, and because such organizations tend to be established for certain purposes, and have their own commonly understood methods for making decisions, their own internal logic, not to mention the fact that the undeniable brute fact of the existence of the unity-collectivity can create self-referential interests in its members, such as the interest to keep the collectivity alive and operating and growing for its own sake, which exist apart from the members&apos; prior interests and the prior purpose for the creation of that collectivity, and which give it freer play to operate by its own internal logic because those interests ensure that it has at least some constitutive entities which will serve it instead of subjecting it to their own other interests. You can see examples of this kind of emergent behavior especially with corporate bureaucracies.

I think it might be a good idea to expand on the idea of _collective force_ a little, because it&apos;s important to Neo-Proudhonian theory and it will make what I&apos;m saying about a unity-collectivity being more than the sum of its parts clearer. Quoting now from Proudhon:

&gt; Collective force is thus something other than the sum of the individual forces of which it is made up: I add that in the application it is, by virtue of its unity, greater than that sum.
&gt; 
&gt; A man, whose muscular strength, in all parts of his body, is equal to six times that of an individual of average vigor, would not only render as much effective labor as six men, but in a struggle he would lay them low. The reason is that, being able to deploy on each side a superior power, or to oppose a superior resistance, he crushes his divided adversaries in a mass.
&gt; 
&gt; This is the image of the group: its strength or force, numerically equal to that of its components, is more than equal in its unity to all together specifically. The military men know it well, their whole science consists, through progressions of attacks and retreats combined, in breaking up the enemy mass so that they can oppose everywhere a greater force to lesser forces.
&gt; 
&gt; A warship with 100 cannons will chase off 500 fishing boats; a steamer with a force of 100 horsepower, giving the same service as a crew of 100 horses, will be much superior to them with regard to general costs and risks; a large agricultural operation will give, for the same amount of land cultivated, finer and more abundant products, and at lower cost, than would a dozen little farms. The mechanical arts abound with facts of this nature: the Creusot steam hammer, which represents in weight two or three hundred times the big hammer of a blacksmith, produces more effect in a single fall than two hundred blows struck by a worker; the work of a mechanical saw offers more precisions that if it is used by a half-dozen arms; the sound created by one hundred singers in unison is truer than each of the individual voices. --- Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, [_Principles of the Philosophy of Progress_](https://www.libertarian-labyrinth.org/proudhon-library/p-j-proudhon-principles-of-the-philosophy-of-progress-selections/) 

Essentially, collective force is an emergent property of collective action, which gives a unity-collectivity far more power --- a much greater ability to accomplish its goals for itself or the world --- than any one person working alone could hope to achieve no matter how long they tried, and so far more than any number of people working completely alone could achieve. Consider an example from _What is Property?_ where Proudhon mentions that a thousand workers working together for twenty days can achieve what would be completely impossible for a single worker working fifty-five years to achieve --- why is this?

Well, as one example, working with the help of others, you can take advantage of greater knowledge than any one person can possess, and that knowledge can add together in such a way that it actually multiplies the usefulness of other knowledge: two pieces of information, apart, may not be very useful, and so the sum of their separated use might not be very large, but when actually communicated to each other and assembled together, they might mean a lot, and contribute something much greater.

For another example, when working with others, you can apply everyone&apos;s strength _all at once_, and in the same organized direction, and make a big push, whereas, if each were to apply themselves individually to the same task, they would be applying each of their strengths individually and not make much of a dent at all, so that overall the sum of their individual accomplishments would add up to much less than the combination. Imagine here attempting to lift a heavy statue upright, or something to that effect.

There is also the emergent properties of the division of labor and specialization, and the ability to do things simultaneously that would otherwise have to be done sequentially, which makes certain operations possible that would not have been physically possible at all if they had to be done sequentially, and even more emergent properties besides. If you look into any manufacturing process, or spend any time working in a group, you&apos;ll come across an endless variety of examples of this. For a small example I&apos;m sure everyone has experienced, sometimes, when constructing something --- I know this because of my experience building robots and furniture! --- it is actually impossible to do it without two or more people, because you need someone to hold a piece in place or move something, while you are focused on doing something else.

The principle behind this, that of a combination being more effective than an individual through the application of the whole power of the combination to an individually lesser task, where, when separated, the constituents of the combination wouldn&apos;t be equal to the tasks, is demonstrated in reverse by the division of labor: instead of combining force to conquer a greater task, a task is split up into easier ones so that a lesser force can deal with them. This is, again, something Proudhon talks about in great depth:

&gt; Thus, in the division of labor as in the collective force, the principle is the same: it is to always attack a lesser task with a greater force. While, in one case, the laborers, individually too weak, form into groups, in the other they break, as it were, the bundle of their operations, in order to take them up again, with more advantage, in detail. What the group, with its immense power, is in comparison to a mass inaccessible to the individual, that one becomes vis-à-vis some fragmented operations, the ensemble of which makes up its industry. --- Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, [_The Principles of the Philosophy of Progress_](https://www.libertarian-labyrinth.org/proudhon-library/p-j-proudhon-principles-of-the-philosophy-of-progress-selections/)

### Forces in Collectivities and Society

Every individual and unity-collectivity in society, at whatever scale you wish to consider the collectivity of &quot;society,&quot; every social entity, exerts its power according to its will and capacity --- on the social entities around it, on the world, and on itself, in an exercise of self-determination but also the elaboration and expression of the self in the world at large. This is Nietzsche&apos;s will to power as it exists in the social world. Of all the vast panoply of expressions of will and power, I am interested in is those which involve the social world --- the complex interplay of sometimes-aligned, sometimes-opposed interests, the push and pull, give and take, aid and war, of social reality.

And what exertions of power involve the social world? _Any_ desire that we, or any other social entity, may have about the material world around us, or relations and arrangements between us and others, which takes place in society, _concerns_ other social entities, as they will be effected. Every social entity has a different set of desires, different things to exert their power for and different ways to use it, different degrees of it, according to their capacity and willingness, but let me show you how this applies to the everyday life of the individual:

- We might exert this power to protect the necessities of life and protect ourselves from harm, against those who might wish to hurt us or prevent this.

- We might exert our power to protect a space for ourselves in the world that is solely ours --- our homes, for instance --- and this, again, requires repelling the interests and powers of those who might want our home for themselves.

- We might exert our power to create other spheres within which we can freely move and express ourselves and make our fingerprint on the world felt (all the same thing, merely expressed in degrees).

- We might exert this power to protect the people and causes and things we care about.

But this brings about conflict, because the full extent of the desires of all cannot all be satisfied.

The &quot;direction&quot; of any individual or unity-collectivity, what it ends up doing and the states it ends up in, is determined by the press of its power against the powers of others seeking to push it in the directions they please, just like the direction of any object in Newtonian physics --- if we pretend that the internal force of a social entity is yet another force acting upon it, just emanating from it --- is determined by the sum of all the vector forces that act on it in various different directions. Furthermore, the force that a social entity exerts from within itself is merely the sum of the forces internal to it, as they modify and conflict and find harmony with each other, so that the direction of any society is ultimately determined by the balance of forces of its components set against the balance of forces of its surroundings.

Thus society is an eternal struggle, and the key is to always maintain vigilance --- find allies, arrange associations, and create mutually beneficial relationships to defend your interests --- because if you drop your guard for even one moment, that will be taken advantage of. To give up that responsibility is to cease using your power for yourself, and to lend it to another, who _will_ use it against you. Thus Novatore says,

&gt; But you, oh rabble, may not yet know how to adapt yourself to the idea of eternal war, you who have cradled yourself like a poor baby in the sweet dreams of eternal peace... And to think that even the blind would have to notice by now that anyone who isn’t able to accept eternal war as his affirmation and triumph must accept eternal slavery... --- Renzo Novatore, [_Cry of Rebellion_](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/renzo-novatore-cry-of-rebellion)

Society is war. It is also peace, love, and reciprocity. But because of the nature of social existence, it is always also the product of mutually opposing forces, testing each other and pushing against each other. But this war does not have to be open, bloody war, with winners and losers: it can also be balance, the meeting of forces, equilibrium. But to maintain equilibrium, both forces must always _push_.

## Conclusion

To summarize, then, I have drawn a picture of society where the direction of everything in it, and of the thing as a whole, is determined by the complex interplay, the push and pull, of all sorts of forces generated by an endless array of various social entities, which themselves can be analyzed in the same terms, as microcosms of the same composition and subject to the same kinds of rules about forces. This is, in practice, an immensely complex beast to draw out, but I think applying this sort of analysis to real world political problems is often fruitful: asking questions like &quot;where does this ideology/organization/group&apos;s power come from?&quot;, or &quot;how is their power directed, through what channels?&quot; or &quot;is it really controlling its power, or lending it to something else?&quot; or &quot;what interests actually directly effect this outcome, and which are just given lip service to?&quot; can often lead to really enlightening answers.

For instance, voting: do people really exercise their power over the government? If you actually look at it, the answer has to be no, because they do not set their power up in opposition to the government. They let the government direct them, and so let it direct their power. They don&apos;t actually threaten the government with anything real should it not do what they want. No matter what laws are made, for the most part, people will generally obey them, and maintain the state&apos;s legitimacy. They won&apos;t actively resist or overthrow the state, force it to do what they want. So the &quot;power&quot; that people exercise over the government is really just the government&apos;s promise, kept out of precarious good will and the adherence to ideology on the part of government officials, and one that can&apos;t even be enforced. Suddenly, the reason why the government rarely actually does what people want, makes a lot of sense!

Of course, this picture of society as the interplay of power is incomplete if you only emphasize the ways powers have to be set against each other. Interests can align, and powers can combine together. Like I said, society also has peace, love, harmony --- and most importantly, [mutual recognition and gift](https://www.libertarian-labyrinth.org/contrun/the-gift-economy-of-property/), the maintenance of norms that benefit myself by the respect of them towards others. We can choose to use our power to _grant_ things to others _in return_ for a reciprocal grant on their part, abstracting away the necessary costs involved if we were to directly grasp with our own power what we wanted others to grant by giving others something in return for granting it to us, and thereby achieving what might not be possible or practical just by the exercise of our own power. But I&apos;ve already talked about that idea a lot in other essays, and it can be subsumed under the idea of &quot;mutual association&quot; for the defense of one&apos;s interests through the collective application of power, so I think it&apos;s enough to just mention it to make sure it isn&apos;t forgotten.

## Onward

In the [next essay](/2022/07/27/process4.html), we&apos;ll be taking a look at what this social theory has to say about the organization of society if we want it to represent everyone&apos;s interests, instead of trampling over the interests of some for the gain of others.</content><author><name>Alexis Purslane</name></author><category term="anarchism" /><summary type="html">[T]he things that we do together with others do not simply add up… specialization and association bring about the formation of unity-collectivities, social beings with qualities, strengths and perhaps even ideas that arise from the combination and unification of the constituent beings. — Shawn P.

  &lt;p&gt;Proudhon really did imagine a world in which the only laws were those of nature and where “rights,” as he explained in War and Peace, referred to nothing more than the future needs of developing individuals. This anarchistic vision of Proudhon’s is so stark that we often seem simply not to recognize it as such, but it seems to be the foundation for virtually all of his thought. We can talk about a “system of justice” in Proudhon’s work, but only if we limit ourselves to that previously mentioned social system [described only by the equality of standing of persons, and the resulting collective force of their association]. Justice for Proudhon was simply balance, unmediated by any hierarchy or authority. — Shawn P. Wilbur, &lt;a href=&quot;https://c4ss.org/content/41502&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Limiting Conditions and Local Desires&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So. Society is the outcome of an eternal, ongoing process of push and pull: “social war,” if you will. That doesn’t sound like the theories of social harmony and mutual gain and benefit that anarchists are known for, now does it? In fact, it sounds downright Darwinian, even Malthusian, and certainly a bit, well, Nietzschiean. You’ll be glad to know, however, that this theory is just a theory — it has no normative implications. It doesn’t tell us what we should try to achieve. And in my case, I wish to achieve egalitarianism, equality, mutual benefit — in other words, anarchism. How do we transform this admittedly rather ugly description of society into a practical account of how we get and keep anarchy? That is exactly what I’ll be discussing in this essay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-balance-of-social-forces&quot;&gt;The Balance of Social Forces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the direction of a society is determined by the forces contained within it, if the forces in society are out of balance, with some forces dominating, that society will inexorably begin moving in the direction those forces dictate, serving the interests of the social entities that predominate in power and subordinating — ultimately erasing completely — the interests of those that do not. The state of society, who it serves, what each of the social entities can achieve and do, will all bend to the power of the dominating forces, whether they want to or not. There may be more or less resistance, but ultimately that resistance will be worn down. This is an elaborated, large scale version of the effects of power-over as opposed to equal power, as I described in “Power and Hierarchy”: when there is an inequality of power, interests are subordinated; when there is equality, they are considered equally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In societies that have a state, the predominant power in that society is the state itself: through its myths of legitimacy and its use of force to cow and beat and scare its citizens, to create coordination problems for those who would resist it, it wields the might of almost the full population under its rulership. Thus, the state is really composed of two parts: the organization itself, the actual members of the state bureaucracy, and the mass of people which tacitly support it, lending their power to it through their apathy and fear. In a society where the state predominates, the state dictates the parameters of what can happen in society almost exclusively; therefore, whoever can &lt;em&gt;capture&lt;/em&gt; the state gets unilateral say in what interests are served and what aren’t. Any attempt to put “checks and balances” on the power of the state is ultimately futile in the long run, however, as long as the state remains a state, because they will have to be &lt;em&gt;components of the state&lt;/em&gt; themselves, parts of the same organization, created out of the same people, sharing many of the same interests, and having no truly separate power to wield against the other parts of the state. Ultimately, there is no way to ensure the state represents any interests other than its own, because without something separate from it and equally powerful, there is nothing really to hold it accountable to the promises it makes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state can be captured by a myriad of interests — religious nationalists, or liberal progressives, or fascist dictators, or neoliberal capitalist cronies — as the other powers in society dictate, especially in comparison to the power of the state bureaucracy itself, and in each of these cases the arc of society will be forcefully bent in the direction that party chooses until such a time as their power is broken. In a capitalist society, the people most able to truly capture the levers of power are, of course, the rich and powerful, the capitalists. This can be expressed in explicit bargains with the state, beneficial regulations and manipulations of the market, protections of artificial monopolies, but it is also far subtler and far-reaching: even in countries that seem more democratic, the law itself was typically originally created by the rich elites and wealthy landowners, and legitimized to the people through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gutenberg.org/files/7370/7370-h/7370-h.htm#CHAPTER_V&quot;&gt;self-serving myths&lt;/a&gt;, for their own mutual protection, making the very foundations of modern liberal legal systems designed to protect the elite classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In societies without the state, likewise, different forces can predominate, depending on circumstance and the nature and history of the society and the culture of the people within it. Thus, in the “power vacuums” that are left over after the collapse of states, or in the warzones that nations create fighting each other, we see the back and forth play of other forces: warlords, gangs, foreign powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of this, the only possible way to create a society which serves the interests of all, which treats all interests equally and is not dominated in its historical arc by some overpowering social entity’s power, is to create a balance of power between all of the different myriad powers in society. Each social entity that has significant power must be balanced by another, and that by another (either by the first one or another one), in all of the different spheres and dimensions in which power can be exerted. The unity-collectivities which defend people must be balanced against each other, as must the economic forces, cultural forces — everything. Any institutions or norms that are established must have, outside of them and equal to them, separate from them, mutually opposing and balancing forces which check their progress. The entirety of society must be a cross-hatched network of mutually opposing forces, all networked together in a loop, all pushing and pulling and balancing each other out, so that no imbalances of power can exist:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Fully-connected_mesh_network.svg/2277px-Fully-connected_mesh_network.svg.png&quot; alt=&quot;fully connected mesh network&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way to achieve this is to radically decentralize and distribute power. The power of violence, defense, and enforcement, economic power, social power, any kind of power conceivable, must be decentralized, broken up, opposed to itself, and in doing so distributed to as many different social entities as possible. This is both the necessary precondition and the end state of anarchy, where everyone holds power over everything that effects them equally, everyone is as empowered and enabled as possible. Without that, some predominating power will always crush and destroy any interests that oppose it or don’t concern it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize: the instinct to plan out the specific norms and institutions of society is a contradictory, dangerous one. The only proper attitude is one of… lassiez-faire, let’s say — a willingness to let the anarchic encounter play out in all its million forms however it might. But, with that in mind, there are some essential things that we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; say about society and the necessary conditions of anarchism; not specific prescriptions of institutions and norms, and so not a social plan, but an analysis of the real, actual, &lt;em&gt;Wertfrei&lt;/em&gt; laws of social reality — a social theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I, like any anarchist, have my pet-favorite norms and institutions — individualist anarchist for sure, with a mixture of communism — and have some idea of which norms are likely to prevail and which not under conditions of equality, and some idea of how such a society must be structured in order to ensure social balance, the most I can really say is that such a balance &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be achieved for anarchy to be possible. And that any society without such a balance is doomed to drift off into disaster, dragged inexorably down by its own internal contradictions and imbalances, slowly spinning out of control until the center cannot hold and all hell breaks loose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems to be close to the picture of society that Proudhon himself had in mind. A society not explicitly defined by any particular laws or norms, but instead by conditions of balance, the equality of individuals and collectivities, which, through its own reasoning, experience, learning, and responsiveness to needs, would &lt;em&gt;Progress&lt;/em&gt;, continually change and adapt, constructing and destroying norms in different places and times as needed to balance the interests of all. To close with a quote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The “anarchism without adjectives” position was a reaction to this kind of doctrinaire model-building, and the resulting conflicts between the proponents of various totalizing blueprints for society… The basic idea was that anarchists should stop feuding over the specific economic model of a future anarchist society, and leave that for people to work out for themselves as they saw fit. Economic ideas like Proudhon’s mutualism, Tucker’s individualist free enterprise and Kropotkin’s communism were complementary, and in a post-state society a hundred flowers would bloom from one locality, one social grouping, to the next…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Any post-state society will include both individuals and communities adhering to many conflicting ideas of just what “freedom,” “autonomy” and “rights” entail. Whatever “law code” communities operate by will be worked out, not as obvious logical deductions from axioms, but through constant interaction between individuals and groups asserting their different understandings of what rights and freedom entail. And it will be worked out after the fact of such conflicts, through the practical negotiations of the mediating and adjudicating bodies within communities. — Kevin Carson, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anarchism-w-o-adjectives&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anarchism Without Adjectives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Justice is a product of conditions, not a prescription of conclusions --- this is the key insight that lies at the heart of much of my discussion of anarchism. In conditions lacking [hierarchy and power-over](https://blog.alexispurslane.xyz/2022/07/18/power-and-hierarchy.html) --- the [anarchic encounter](https://blog.alexispurslane.xyz/2022/07/10/anarchic-encounter.html) --- the interests of each individual and collectivity that is party to any decision must be weighed equally and treated with respect, factored into the final decision, instead of subordinated to any other. As a consequence, any decision which springs out of the fertile ground of anarchy, watered with the blood of those who fight the ceaseless battle of vigilance against the reconstitution of domination, will be a decision which protects the full flourishing of [individual autonomy](https://blog.alexispurslane.xyz/2022/06/23/autonomy.html) --- the goal of [my anarchism](https://blog.alexispurslane.xyz/2022/01/17/what-is-individualist-anarchism.html). These decisions need not --- _will_ not --- follow any plan or pattern which I can lay out ahead of time; they will be specific to the local conditions and unique needs of those involved, drawing on tacit knowledge and common practice as well as more abstract things like science. This is a very good thing, too, because there are inherent compromises and blind spots in any social plan or set of institutions, which can vary in importance depending on the situation, so that if we are to subordinate norms to needs, the norms must be fluid and specific. Chosen by those who will follow them.

This means that I cannot present a single set of social norms or institutions as &quot;what anarchy must be,&quot; as many vulgar market anarchists and communist anarchists do. I can provide examples of one way things _can_ work, a toolkit of various historically-inspired anarchist means of organizing and handling things like conflict, resource distribution, and community defense, which can provide a lifeline for those worried about what life might look like after the capitalism and the state, and I can even try to predict to some degree how things might fall out, but I cannot provide a social plan and enforce it. That would be to introduce a hierarchy in Stirner&apos;s sense, a subjugation of the individual will and interest to an idea, an abstraction --- a phantom.

The implications of this approach to anarchy, prefigured by Stirner, Novatore, and Proudhon, are far-reaching, and in this series of essays, titled &quot;Anarchism: Process, Not Destination,&quot; I will be examining four interesting and important results of thinking about anarchism in this way:

1. In [part one](/2022/07/27/process1.html) of this series, I will explain why insurrectionary anarchism is superior to revolutionary anarchism, and how this is related to totalizing social plans;
2. In [part two](/2022/07/27/process2.html) of this series, I will examine why social planning is both undesirable and contradictory to the goals of anarchism, and how responding to that leads one to social theory instead of social planning;
3. In [part three](/2022/07/27/process3.html) of this series, I will lay out my Neo-Proudhonian theory of how societies work;
4. And in [part four](/2022/07/27/process4.html) of this series, I will apply that social theory to explain why anarchism is better than other ways of organizing society.

In order to fight back against something, after all, you have to be able to identify it. I began this project from an unorthodox angle in my account of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.alexisdumas.org/2022/07/10/anarchic-encounter.html&quot;&gt;anarchic encounter&lt;/a&gt;, but I think a few words (at least) are necessary concerning the nature of hierarchies, authority, domination, subordination, and power-over; after all, these are the structural factors which either create the space for, or preclude, the anarchic encounter, and which my theory of justice-as-balance is linked to, as a sort of test for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I jump in, however, I need to set the table — elaborate on some core concepts of my social critique in general, and relate them to this project of understanding power and hierarchy specifically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like my conception of justice itself, my conception of hierarchy (and henceforth also authority and subordination, which should be read implicitly whenever I mention it from now on) is not one based on a set of rigid rules or relations which are prohibited in the case of hierarchy just as they are prescribed in the case of justice. Hierarchy wears as many faces as there are human faces, as many shapes as there are places and times in the world where people interact. It is one of the most versatile things in existence. It is a description of a social relationship, and human social relationships are infinitely, fractally complex, an interplay between the endless subtle variety and detail of objective states of the world, and the infinite nuance of subjectivity, perception, and language. In fact, the existence of hierarchy is ultimately a subjective phenomenon, created by the &lt;em&gt;feelings&lt;/em&gt; of those involved — their feelings of choice or lack of choice, which motivate their actions with respect to one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might sound unsettling, but it’s okay to leave wiggle room, exceptions, spaces for exploration and situational decisions and subjectivity, in things like this. Social science is broad, deep, and ever-shifting. I think Wittgenstein’s concept of &lt;a href=&quot;http://fs2.american.edu/dfagel/www/Class%20Readings/Wittgenstein/Philosophical%20Investigations%20\(1st%20100\).html#65&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;family resemblance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is something especially useful to invoke here — I can present a sort of general “example” of a lot of things that I consider instances of hierarchy by giving an abstract account, but specific instances are going to be related to this in different ways than each other or even only transitively related to the examples I give, related to each other and then some of their number related to the example. Indeed, there might even be tensions or contradictions between specific instances, even as they are related to each other or related to other common instances as well. Thus there is ultimately no essence to these things at all, no necessary and sufficient conditions that make something hierarchy or not-hierarchy, nor any “central example” that all other examples are directly related to even in diverse ways. Just the presence of a resemblance between one instance and another instance, in a criss-crossing quilt of such resemblances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any attempt to come up with a complete account of any ethical concept, such as justice, self-defense, hierarchy, or whatever else you please, is bound to fall afoul of exceptions, which one is either then forced to accept — making that account a sacred idea that you bow down to, over and above your own intuitions, feelings, and needs in the moment regarding specific matters — or which one is forced to accommodate by adding ever more epicycles to the theory until it is basically no guide at all (the way that guides is not the constant way).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless I think it is worth taking a stab at it. Not as a complete description, but as a sort of &lt;em&gt;generalized example&lt;/em&gt; which can serve as something to build a proper form of family resemblance off of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;coercion&quot;&gt;Coercion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s begin with a basic concept: &lt;strong&gt;coercion&lt;/strong&gt;. Someone is coerced into making a choice when their list of acceptable alternative choices is so restricted as to make that choice the only acceptable one, or at least one of very few acceptable alternatives, especially when these choices themselves are not something one would choice were their choices not as restricted (when the choice is not choiceworthy in itself and is even an unnecessarily poor means of achieving its end). In other words, one can say one’s choice to do something is less free the less freedom remains to you should you make each one of the alternative choices available to you, and still less free if the best choice you have leaves you little freedom as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an analogy, I am less free in my choice of direction if, proceeding down a tunnel, I come to a fork, where one path continues on (if perhaps narrower), while the other ventures on a little way and then ends in a dead end. Likewise, if, continuing down the narrower tunnel, as I proceed, I find that I have fewer new branches to go down than I did in the tunnels I left behind, I am, again, less free, because my freedom of movement is more restricted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might notice at this point that this account of coercion implies that &lt;a href=&quot;https://cathyreisenwitz.substack.com/p/consent-is-non-binary&quot;&gt;coercion is a spectrum&lt;/a&gt; — the list of acceptable choices can vary in length (or they can even have no physical choice at all in extreme cases), the relative acceptability of the choices can change in degree, and the choices that are available to you in the future after you make the choice currently at hand might change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this account of coercion implies that whether coercion is present or not is up to the person who is &lt;em&gt;in the situation in question&lt;/em&gt; — it is at least partially subjective! After all, how much someone is coerced into a choice is dependent not on the objective existence of viable alternatives or the objective freedom that different choices would allow in the future, as if we were able to somehow have insight into those alternate universes; it is dependent on the &lt;em&gt;perceived&lt;/em&gt; choices, or lack thereof, and their &lt;em&gt;perceived&lt;/em&gt; quality! This intuitively makes sense: if someone holds a gun to my head and tells me to do something, I am coerced into doing it even if, unbeknownst to me, the gun isn’t loaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should also be noted that coercion can be achieved actively, by the person benefiting from the coerced choice, as in the case of making someone do something by putting a gun to their head, or &lt;em&gt;passively&lt;/em&gt;, by merely taking advantage of someone’s already dire circumstances, their lack of alternative options. In either case the result is the same, and in many such cases the surrounding conditions which enable such “passive” coercion are in fact artificial and constructed for the benefit of the person taking advantage, and as such the lines between these two are also often blurry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that saying that coercion is subjective and exists on a spectrum is not to deny that coercion not used in self-defense can’t be distinctly pointed out, referred-to, and understood, or can’t be treated as undesirable. This fear that if something is complex, multifaceted, and has elements of subjectivity in it, it must be invalid and disappear under investigation is simply the ludicrous result of modernist bastardizations of scientism and positivism, the hundred-times picked over crumbs of our “Enlightenment inheritance.” We can still understand when something is clearly taking place from an external point of view by analyzing the factors at play, the structures, systems, and individuals which compose them; we can analyze the severity of what is taking place and decide for ourselves what is too severe; we can &lt;em&gt;ask&lt;/em&gt; the people involved and understand and learn from their perspectives. After all, one can turn to a friend and ask them what happened somewhere, and believe them, without a scientific investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To a certain extent, in a technical sense, we all exercise “coercion,” because self-defense does exactly what I described above: it makes people that want to hurt us not do so by using violence or the threat of it. Likewise, we “force” people to deal with us fairly, instead of dominating us or being tyrannical over us, through the threat of using violence if they don’t. But this is merely the absolutism of the free absolute, the unique, which defends its own. It is in fact, in a sense, the precondition for the anarchic encounter at all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crucial difference between these kinds of “egalitarian,” unobjectionable uses of “coercion” and coercion exercised in a way that leads to power over others, hierarchy, domination, etc. (which is typically what people are referring to when they call something coercion) is that in the second case, it’s aggressive interference — marching into someone’s life and telling them what to do and not to do when otherwise they would’ve had nothing to do with you, or taking control of the things they use to maintain their lives — while in the more common case it’s a reaction, it’s defensive — we are controlling their lives in a sense, but only to get them to stop dominating and controlling ours. I don’t want to become my landlord’s landlord, I just want to get him to stop being my landlord, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether someone is controlling others only to not themselves be controlled, or controlling others for the purpose merely of controlling them is a detailed, case by case thing, an area that I leave up to judgment, although I don’t think it’s very often a difficult thing to determine — just ask whose life is effected more by the use of coercion. If what you want to control effects my life more than yours, then you are trying to control me — if your life more than mine, you are more interested in controlling yourself. Thus for instance if someone is trying to outlaw public displays of affection on the part of queer people because they don’t want to see it, they are trying to control queer people, because that effects queer people’s lives far more than their own (not having to see something you can easily ignore, versus not being able to express affection toward a loved one).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key here, ultimately, seems to be whether something is &lt;em&gt;invasive&lt;/em&gt; or not, just as Tucker says in his writings — but that itself seems to boil down to equality of a sort, so, the key to justice remains equality, as Proudhon thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;power-over-domination&quot;&gt;Power-Over (Domination)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next concept is &lt;strong&gt;power over&lt;/strong&gt;, or domination. Power-over is constituted in the ability to get an advantage over someone else — to get what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; want out of some interaction or relationship with much less significant concern for the interests of the others involved. Power over someone or some situation lets you set the terms of a bargain unilaterally, or nearly so, to extract more out of the relationship than the other parties to a relationship get, makes one party more beholden to the interests of the other, and so on. Power-over is usually only possible when coercion is forcing people to interact with the person who wants it, so that they can’t simply reject a relation which is inequitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example is, for instance, bosses who have to care very little about the happiness of the employees under them, can ignore employee input, etc, while the employees have to worry a lot about displeasing their boss all the time, because they might lose their job, which is a seriously bad option much of the time. Another example is the classic example of capitalist profit: since capitalists own the means of production and people need to eat, they have extremely unequal bargaining power and so can get much more out of the deal than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Power-over is distinct from “mere” power because we &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; want, and possess, power to one degree or another. This is implicit in all of my previous discussion in this essay already — we all possess a will to power, and varying degrees of ability to project that power into our lives and the world around us. The more capacity we have to express our will to power, the more self-actualized we are capable of being, and so empowerment itself is neither good nor evil, and when considered in isolation can indeed be a great, beautiful thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Power only becomes dangerous to anarchism, a servant of hierarchy, when there is an inequality of power between those who have competing interests in some affair. That is when power &lt;em&gt;over&lt;/em&gt; someone is possible: when you exercise your greater power to get what you want in a situation where someone else is effected by what you are doing and has interests contrary to yours, but can’t stand against you. Therefore, part of the project of anarchism is to empower everyone &lt;em&gt;equally&lt;/em&gt;, so that everyone has power, which means that no one has power &lt;em&gt;over&lt;/em&gt; anyone else. There are many ways of doing that — a cultural commitment to leveling mechanisms that ensure that leadership and authority are at most temporary tools, decentralization of systems and distribution of decision-making power, providing support and mutual aid for people to multiply their power, proper tools for self-defense and security, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is opposed to the statist solution to power-over, which is to equally disempower everyone, subjecting them all to the same laws, rules, and regulations, so that they are all equally powerless in the face of forces that decide from outside what conditions must be like — a self-defeating notion because it inherently requires an &lt;em&gt;even greater&lt;/em&gt; power-over, which then creates exactly the sort of domination and hierarchy, exactly the sort of power-over, that one sought to avoid in the first place. Thus we go from the occasional &lt;a href=&quot;https://thewhyaxis.substack.com/p/cops-still-take-more-stuff-from-people&quot;&gt;thief or burglar to asset forfeiture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again the key seems to be equality and balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hierarchy-and-authority&quot;&gt;Hierarchy and Authority&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, finally, we arrive at &lt;strong&gt;hierarchy&lt;/strong&gt;: hierarchy is the reification and perpetuation of power and coercion. Hierarchy, and its accompanying authority, takes relationships of power-over and legitimizes them, by constructing some sustaining myth about how they are inevitable, inescapable, good, or necessary. By this means, relations of power which are ultimately arbitrary, created by happenstance or particular contextual or environmental factors, are transformed into things that are preserved and actively perpetuated by both the people that benefit from them and those that are on the losing end of them. Thus we get the divine right of kings, social contract theory, natural law, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once legitimating myths concerning these relations of power are created, the processes of perpetuation and preservation of these power relations start to turn into patterns, and then these patterns themselves are reified into myths, traditions, norms, and, eventually, laws, further feeding the cycle. After that, the hierarchy is reified (thing-ified) and made into a solid, stable entity both conceptually and materially. The concept of the hierarchy is turned into something separate from the people and actions that actualize it into something with its own force, its own wants, needs, and obligations, while that concept is also given tangible reality which further perpetuates the myth of the concept’s independent reality. Thus hierarchies can be understood in terms of the relatively stable patterns of behavior that they engender, distorting the social fabric around themselves, and also the physical, material changes they make to our reality: government buildings, road blocks, fences, ghettos, police cars. All of these things reinforce the hierarchy, make it seem all the more just &lt;em&gt;part of reality itself&lt;/em&gt;, all the more inescapable and inevitable, in a feedback loop of self-creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, once a relationship of power has been turned into a hierarchy, legitimized, and reified into a set of institutions, where this vicious cycle of self-reinforcement can begin, problems of coordination and collective action become serious. If a system has overwhelming power behind it, so that no single individual could stand completely against it for long, it becomes necessary to coordinate action; the problem is, such action is lethal and also largely pointless on the part of each individual, so each individual needs to be able to guarantee that the others will join in, and this can be difficult because there is an incentive for each individual to defect to save their own hides or even make a deal with the powers-that-be. How to resist this problem and powerful hierarchies themselves is far outside my wheelhouse, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is by no means a complete account. Instead, it is a hasty sketch which grew out of a flash of inspiration while writing another essay. Nevertheless, I think it offers some useful conceptual tools in an accessible package and perhaps has some unique ideas about how to construct a framework through which to understand and critique power and hierarchy. That’s all I aim to do, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alexis Purslane</name></author><category term="ethics" /><category term="anarchism" /><summary type="html">Identifying inequalities of power, instances of domination which creates the space for hierarchies and other forms of authority and subordination, is one of the cornerstones anarchist political and social theory.

What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a woman? Just what does that &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt;? Well, I’ve got a simple, compact answer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;b style=&quot;font-size: 22px&quot;&gt;A woman is someone who identifies with womanhood.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t go beyond that for anyone in general conversation, certainly not with someone who asks that question as a challenge or in a “debate me bro” way, because actually elaborating on what you mean by that will take a lot of time and they’ll be likely to just dismiss you as dodging the question or being a post-modern neo-Marxist or whatever the fuck as soon as you start to take longer than a few seconds to answer. Because to them, everything has to have a simple, rigid answer, everything has to fit into neat little boxes and pre-defined roles. Subjects can’t be genuinely complex and sometimes fuzzy and subjective or relative for them, they start out with a presupposition that all that kind of stuff is “woke nonsense.” This is the deep-seated anti-intellectualism of the right that serves as a defense mechanism for having to change their minds. That’s why Matt Walsh’s documentary is so disingenuous to the core — he dismisses anything that sounds complicated or vague to him because ultimately it isn’t meant to be a measure of who can actually answer, or who’s right, it’s a measure of his own low comprehension abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, let’s dig into the meaning behind this a little deeper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many different ways in which (or reasons why) one can identify with womanhood — even among cis women opinions vary, and in feminist philosophy it has been a hotly debated subject for at least a century, not to mention that the concept itself is socioculturally dependent, and is imbued with deep history — but that’s okay, the important thing is that people who identify as women will typically tell you if you ask (that’s why the simple way to answer is “whoever identifies as a woman”) and also use (some of) the culturally constructed ways that we have of ‘performing womanhood’ to broadcast their identity because, typically, it both expresses their inward identification with womanhood (and so makes them happy) and helps their identity be recognized by others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A woman is not a woman by virtue of this outward performance any more than house with a different coat of paint is a different house, because this outward appearance can always be taken away by force or circumstance, or merely not be of interest to them, and exactly what looks “enough like a woman” or even “looks like a woman” in the first place is subjective and blurry, but it is one indicator of that inward identification with the female gender. So, it is this identification of one’s ideal self with womanhood that makes the difference to my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, to determine what constitutes “womanhood,” or to identify a woman, or even use the word “woman,” we don’t even need to come up with a list of necessary and sufficient conditions — an essence — that is common to all women! If you think about it, we don’t do that for most of the words we use: instead, we have examples of what to use the word on, drawn from our experience using language with other people, and we consider the word to apply to anything that bears a resemblance to those examples. In that fashion we are able to productively use the word and understand what it means in a broad, holistic sense, without ever needing to come up with a set of properties that everything the word applies to shares: each thing that the word applies to can be related to other things the word applies to in different ways, creating an overlapping, crisscrossing network of &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; relations between each example of the word, where some things are even only related to others through a chain of intermediary relations (like the transitive property in math).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The things a word applies to will all have a sort of “family resemblance”: like a family, there may not even be one thing that every member shares in common, but different things (hair, nose, face, eyes, gait, accent) are relatively alike between different members of the family, in different ways. Not only that, but the borders can be fuzzy, because how much something resembles another is up for debate sometimes — it’s more a relative question of whether something is more like an example of one word, or more like an example of another, because almost everything has a commonality with anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of that doesn’t matter, though, because exactitude isn’t actually a bar to being able to use a word in a language-game and have people understand what you mean. I can say “stand roughly there” or “give me a red square” and you can do as I ask without knowing where I want you to stand down to the inch or knowing exactly which wavelength of light I want the square to be reflecting. Wittgenstein talks about all of this in &lt;a href=&quot;http://fs2.american.edu/dfagel/www/Class%20Readings/Wittgenstein/Philosophical%20Investigations%20\(1st%20100\).html#65&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Philosophical Investigations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in great detail, presenting counter arguments to various objections you’re likely to hear, and I highly recommend reading it. It is dry, but clearly written and, to me, was engaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, when categorizing &lt;em&gt;humans&lt;/em&gt;, often times trying to essentialize us or taxonomize actually ends up doing violence to us far more than actually improving our understanding of ourselves and our (social) reality. After all, even in biology, taxonomy is a discipline with fluid categories, fuzzy definitions, many disputes and open questions, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.alexisdumas.org/2022/06/05/dont-fix-us.html&quot;&gt;numerous exceptions&lt;/a&gt;. That is all the more true with respect to humans, with the added difficulty that there are social realities we have to take into account, and also that we often take our constructed, limited, and non-objective categories as not only absolute, but also as having normative implications, implications which can seriously cause harm to those who aren’t captured accurately by those categorizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me what’s important about being a woman is the family resemblance between what women identify with, how we conceptualize our ideal selves in relation to others who also identify with womanhood, and how we want to be in the world, both personally and socially. This is what is typically termed one’s “gender identity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, a natural question might be — aren’t we reinforcing gender roles by identifying womanhood with cultural constructs? Not at all. The difference between what I do and what your average bioessentialist or conservative traditionalist does is that I’m querying the internal sense of identity of the person in question — I’m asking them whether, to what degree, and in what ways they identify with womanhood, and letting their answer dictate what I believe about them. So a woman who dresses in a masculine way, has a career, has had a hysterectomy, and has no children or husband remains a woman for me because she wants to be a woman in one way or another, wants to exist and be acknowledged as one, whereas a particularly angry traditionalist might deny her her womanhood — or, conversely, a man with long hair who is stereotypically feminine remains a man so long as he wishes to remain one, unlike the schoolyard bully who might call a boy a girl for having long hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise I do not take &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; conceptions of what it means to be a woman, or my ideas about it, as universal or normative: I do not tell a woman who doesn’t relate to womanhood like I do that they are wrong, or failing at womanhood. I do not say to a woman who lies farther along the family resemblance between women, or perhaps at the fuzzy border, that she should move ‘more toward being a woman,’ because she is equally a woman to me, because she still shares that resemblance and, through the transitive property, is related thus to all other women, and there &lt;em&gt;is no center, is no essence&lt;/em&gt; to womanhood for me! Crucially, you will find, that for everyone who truly is a member of their gender, if you deny them their gender they will protest, and if you ask them — and they have time to think about it and a space to answer without feeling judged — they will give you an answer about how they relate to their gender. And that is all that is necessary. For me, womanhood is about the feeling of kinship and identification with other women, the way I want my body to be and the way I want to be treated and exist and present myself in the social world. For my best friend, it’s about wanting her body to be as female as possible (this is why I call myself transgender and she prefers transsexual). But these are equally valid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize — the point is not to abolish identities. Let people who enjoy their identities revel in them, be proud of them, love them, find common cause and community through them, connect to history and literature and poetry through them! The point is to abolish normativity — telling people what identity they should have, or how they have to fulfill that identity. Let each person find their own &lt;em&gt;dao&lt;/em&gt;. This doesn’t just go for womanhood and manhood, either. This framework also allows for the construction of new genders, by creating new sociocultural clusters of associations, roles, presentations, expressions, histories, and identifications with others, to name just a few dimensions along which gender can be understood, or the mixing of manhood and womanhood, or even the rejection of all gender entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what I meant above about trying to force people into essentialized categories ultimately being something that does violence to at least a few of them, maybe all of them to a certain degree. When it comes to matters of social existence and identity, subjectivity and phenomenological experience, complexity and nuance, must be given their due — humans are complex creatures, after all, and I personally wouldn’t have it any other way.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alexis Purslane</name></author><category term="transgender" /><category term="lgbt" /><summary type="html">Since Matt Walsh’s transphobic ‘documentary’ What Is A Woman? was released, I’ve been seeing a lot of people, even allies and members of the LGBT community, reiterating this question.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;authors-note&quot;&gt;Author’s Note&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As has become somewhat of a theme, perhaps even a requirement, for this recent spate of better-quality postings beginning with “Vision of An Anarchist Society,” instead of sitting down to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Write About Something&lt;/code&gt; because I want to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Build A System&lt;/code&gt; and building a system &lt;em&gt;requires&lt;/em&gt; writing on certain subjects — instead of, in other words, treating my blog posts as chapters in a gigantic book that I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to write to “get it out of the way” — I’ve waited until I feel writing on this subject welling up inside me. Until writing on it feels natural, an act of outpouring, as if I was already going to write on this, whether I made the choice or not. I spent two days pondering what I should write about, feeling out all the different topics that have been occupying my mind in the past few months, turning them about in my hands and inspecting them carefully, like fruit, to see which was just ripe enough. I waited until this subject was on the &lt;em&gt;tip of my tongue&lt;/em&gt; to write about it. In other words, I followed &lt;a href=&quot;https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anna-ronan-anarchism-as-a-spiritual-practice&quot;&gt;wu wei&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so I find myself back to staring into the depths of the subject of an anarchist conception of ‘justice’, embodied in a particular kind of relationship, for the first time in six months and three weeks. I’ve tried this project twice before: once, in the fury of inspiration and shocking, icy, firey &lt;em&gt;realization&lt;/em&gt;, which led me to produce “Two Principles,” a work so deeply flawed in so many ways, so full of both my old kinds of thinking &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; my new kinds, that I’m still slowly unpacking and developing everything that was good in it even now; then a second time, in a confused, contemplative, groping essay that represented me trying to really wrestle with and internalize what I’d realized through discussions with someone who was very influential to me at the time. This time, I hope to take the months of deep thinking and experience, and far-ranging reading, that I’ve been carrying out, and apply it to producing something clearer, cleaner, and more coherent than what I’ve written before on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the fundamental characteristic features of anarchism? I think that anarchism is fundamentally defined by a single thing — an opposition to subordination, domination, or hierarchies of power or authority — from which two other things flow naturally, and without which that ‘single thing’ would be incompletely expressed: an opposition to governmentalism (the principle which tries to govern people’s actions or lives) and by extension the state, and a positive love and hope for the possibilities that human beings can create when liberated from hierarchy and government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One crucial part of understanding anarchism, in my view, is understanding its projectual-relational dimension: understanding what relations, both singular and ongoing, between both individuals and collectivities, might look like when taking place in an essentially anarchic manner. This is something which lies at a nexus of sorts at the heart of egoist anarchism itself: an emergent anarchism that is not a prescription of certain social structures, but just what results, in all its plurality and multiplicity, from &lt;em&gt;conditions of anarchism&lt;/em&gt;. Although it won’t have much specific content — it is almost another non-concept like ‘the unique’ and ‘self-interest’ — this can give us some conception of what, although opposed to fixed ideas, we might still colloquially term ‘justice’ — of what we are fighthing &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of pursuing such an understanding, I have found that using the lens of Neo-Proudhonian social science, which sees society as an eternal, ongoing process of balancing conflicting and interpenetrating forces, where the greatest liberty is found precisely at the moment where these contradictory forces are most balanced, to the egoist framework which already sees society as an eternal war between the will to power of each individual, has been extremely fruitful for me. The purpose of this essay is to share that odd synthesis, which I see every so often among other anarchists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make an important clarification, I am not interested in producing rules for the outcomes of justice, whether rules of thumb, or mathematical equations, or categorical imperatives, or tables of virtues and vices, or natural laws. I am interested, instead, in conditions, not conclusions — I am interested in understanding what sorts of arrangements might naturally flow from what is already quintessentially anarchist: the &lt;em&gt;anarchic encounter&lt;/em&gt;, a meeting of two or more equals — Unique ones who accept neither master nor higher power nor sacred idea — on a playing field shaped by all manner of history and circumstance, but no hierarchies, no governments, no authority, no state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it is the embodiment of the anarchist commitment to eliminating &lt;em&gt;archos&lt;/em&gt;, the anarchic encounter represents everything we fight for in the social world, and, as such, it has a direct link to what sorts of arrangements we might find ‘just.’ With that in mind, it is useful to ask: what sorts of arrangements between individuals could (or might tend to) arise from actual conditions free from hierarchy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is with reasoning substantially similar to this that Proudhon dismisses the social contract theory of property: had conditions of equality and universal consent really obtained when such a contract was formed, the result, too, would have had to be equality:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But I wish that this consent, of which so much is made, had been given, either tacitly or formally. What would have been the result? Evidently, the surrenders would have been reciprocal; no right would have been abandoned without the receipt of an equivalent in exchange. We thus come back to equality again… so that, after having justified property by universal consent, that is, by equality, we are obliged to justify the inequality of conditions by property. Never shall we extricate ourselves from this dilemma. Indeed, if, in the terms of the social compact, property has equality for its condition, at the moment when equality ceases to exist, the compact is broken and all property becomes usurpation. We gain nothing, then, by this pretended consent of mankind. — Proudhon, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/proudhon/property/ch03.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;What Is Property?&lt;/em&gt; Chapter II.2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, it is important to remember that if we wish to have an accurate analysis of social justice, we should, unlike &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rawls/&quot;&gt;Rawls&lt;/a&gt;, reject placing this hypothetical understanding of what free and equal people would do above the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; arrangements free people choose to make, or whether there are real relations of hierarchy and subordination warping the fabric of social reality in a given instance. To do otherwise would be just to reproduce yet another sacred idea. (Nor should we assume that society must be planned, and resources distributed, from the top down by a central committee of such psychologically impossible sock-puppets as those placed behind the veil of ignorance.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how I balance the possible tension between my egoism and a concept of justice. As an egoist I am more than free to have interests regarding things other than myself, and there is no fixed concept of self-interest that must motivate me, only an attentiveness to “the feelings and thoughts that are aroused in me by [things],” and it is true that I sincerely hate living in a society which upholds structures of power over me and those I care about, that stomps us beneath its boot — or does so to anyone, for that matter; I also know that my liberty will never be secure until the power of each is unlocked and the cathedrals of power-over-us are razed to the ground. Interests like these are all equal, whether they regard myself, those I care about, or other people whom I don’t know, as long as they remain &lt;em&gt;my own&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am not altruistic so long as the goal remains my own, and instead of stooping to being the blind means of its fulfillment, I always leave it open to question. My zeal doesn’t, therefore, have to be less than the most fanatical, but at the same time I remain frosty cold against it, unbelieving, and its most implacable enemy; I remain its judge, because I am its owner. — &lt;a href=&quot;https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/max-stirner-the-unique-and-its-property&quot;&gt;Max Stirner, &lt;em&gt;The Unique and Its Property&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as part of my will to power, I seek to push forward anarchism, as the &lt;em&gt;sine qua non&lt;/em&gt; of the society I wish to live in, and, as part of that, I view justice-as-balance as a thing that is pleasing to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-anarchic-encounter-and-justice-as-balance&quot;&gt;The Anarchic Encounter and Justice-As-Balance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To return to the subject of the anarchic encounter, now that I’ve outlined what exactly makes it so important, let me have Wilbur speak for me here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[bold is mine] On one level, then, under anarchism we simply see a particular sort of encounter acted out, over and over again: equal individuals meet, find the means to balance their individual interests, and from their association arises something else—a collective something with the potential to emerge as another individual, with interests of its own, which must then figure in &lt;strong&gt;the balancing of interests that is justice&lt;/strong&gt;… Any number of encounters may take place, involving any number of individuals, on any number of scales and creating any number of associations, but the basic elements remain the same. &lt;strong&gt;The social field of play remains level, the status of the individuals—whether self-conscious free absolutes or various sorts of collectivities—remains equal&lt;/strong&gt; before whatever norms and conventions we adopt, and &lt;strong&gt;those norms and conventions always remain subject to critique on the basis of their relationship to the most general, practical sort of equality and justice-balance.&lt;/strong&gt; — Shawn P. Wilbur, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.libertarian-labyrinth.org/contrun/summary-notions/&quot;&gt;“Summary Notions”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand why justice-as-balance is so crucial and why, importantly, it is not so much a normative principle as an epiphenomena that results from the interaction of Uniques, let me quote from a different essay of Wilbur’s:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[bold mine] We begin with these free absolutes, these uniques. According to the first, Proudhonian designation, we are dealing with individuals, groups [in Proudhon’s social science, even individual persons are regarded as groups] organized according to an unfolding law of development, but with a consciousness of their nature and a capacity for self-reflection. &lt;strong&gt;They may, on the one hand, be inclined to absolutism, to taking their internal law for the law of the world, but they are also capable of recognizing another like themselves, and understanding that in a world of absolutes either some must be masters of others, or there must be balance&lt;/strong&gt;. With no criterion of certainty for their observations or judgments, beyond the apparently similarity—in this absolutist dimension—of these otherwise unique beings, &lt;strong&gt;with incommensurable experiences and unknowable essences, they find themselves with equality, Proudhon suggests, as the only basis on which to proceed from individual isolation to society&lt;/strong&gt;. — Shawn P. Wilbur, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.libertarian-labyrinth.org/contrun/the-anatomy-of-the-encounter/&quot;&gt;“The Anatomy of the Encounter”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words: when someone who refuses to bow to anyone or any thing, not even an abstract idea of justice (perhaps derived from, e.g., natural law) is faced with another such 
indomitable will, they have one choice: to duke it out, face each other down, and see who will ultimately be the more powerful and who will be forced to submit to the other, or to compromise. And of course, any compromise between real equals is almost always going to be a 50-50 compromise — balance — in some crucial way, although perhaps not in the same way each time or in an obvious dimension. Thus justice-as-balance emerges as the &lt;em&gt;resultant indicator&lt;/em&gt; of conditions of anarchy, and gains its value not by being enforced from above, but by being the litmus test for that which we already value: a world where, in Novatore’s words, the rabble have ceased to be rabble, and sprung forth in all their flowering potentiality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that true justice, in the anarchist sense, is not the application of a rigid set of rules for how relations should be organized, but the resolution of conflicts in a way that treats everyone’s interests as equal, arrived at through direct reconciliation between the people in conflict by reasoning together, &lt;em&gt;whatever the outcome&lt;/em&gt;. And this is not an categorical imperative, but a flowering forth of that which I already value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way of looking at this is through Stirner’s lens instead of Proudhon’s. While the foregoing discussion has focused on balance because at least some of the interests at play in the anarchic encounter are assumed to be at odds, that is not necessarily the case. Or, at least, it isn’t something we have to focus on to the exclusion of all other kinds of association. When egoists meet and associate, it is of necessity something which must be of benefit to both. The nature of their fluid commitment to only their interests (their &lt;a href=&quot;https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anna-ronan-anarchism-as-a-spiritual-practice&quot;&gt;feelings and needs&lt;/a&gt;) ensures that when that association fails to be of utility to any one involved, it will dissolve:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our relationship is one of mutuality and reciprocity. We both gain what we desire from our union, and thus are satisfied. We consume, but are also consumed… When we no longer find such an association as beneficial to ourselves we withdraw and end the union. The union only exists at the behest of our own individual power. If we find that we are working towards another’s ends, no longer enjoying oneself, or desiring a new activity—we withdraw—ending our association. — Castanea Dentata, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/castanea-dentata-the-union-of-egoists&quot;&gt;“The Union of Egoists”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the nature of such a union is that it must be of mutual — in some sense equal — benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/three_perfections.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Three Perfections, by Huang Binhong&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final note on justice-as-balance is necessary. Whether someone’s interests are equally represented and equally cared about, or one interest is subordinated to another and must supplicate it on terms the dominating interest dictates, must be assessed holistically: if we look at anything but the full picture of a relation, things can get confused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can, for instance, we “balance the interests” of a man who wants to murder someone and the person he wants to murder? You can’t half-murder someone, so what are we supposed to do, let the other man beat him up just half as much as would be necessary to kill him? Cut his throat halfway and then take him to the hospital? Not at all. The answer to this question is to repeal the hidden fallacy and widen our scope: if one man gets his way, their interests are equally represented — both go their own ways alive and whole, living their lives as before, assuming there is no prior hierarchy to speak of — while, if the other gets his way, one will have all his interests obliterated without any consideration whatsoever, and one will get everything he wants and go about his day. Thus, the balancing of the interests of both people is actually the denial of the interests of the would-be murderer, because to do otherwise is itself a clear instance of domination, the subordination of one man’s interests to the other’s, and thus balance is found in destroying this domination, and only then can the anarchic encounter emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, equality itself is a slippery thing: one can be equal or unequal along an infinitude of dimensions, so it is crucial not to pick just &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; dimension of equality (equal wages, or equality under the law, for instance) and ignore the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;justice-and-rationality&quot;&gt;Justice and Rationality&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conditions of equality, where two Uniques or free absolutes who will not yield to each other meet and decided to cooperate or compromise, to find some mutually beneficial arrangement to either further their common interests or balance their opposing ones, what are the means by which they find such a mutually beneficial balance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One tool might be, as the previous quotes from Wilbur hinted at, the application of norms, conventions, or traditions — knowledge about what worked on previous, sufficiently similar, occasions, and common understandings of what manifestations of equality matter, or what equality even really means. But ultimately, if we’re going to be talking about a seriously &lt;em&gt;anarchic&lt;/em&gt; encounter, where no one is governed by anything and no one submits to any authority but their own, those things are at best tools; the encounter and the individuals in it cannot become the property of these traditions. To quote again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Norms, conventions, rules, laws, rights—no matter what language we use to talk about the more persistent aspects of our mutual self-government, the things that that language represents can never assume any authority in and of themselves… Arguably, that means much more than to say that they must not be backed by state or police powers, violence or the threat of violence. If we accept Proudhon’s summary, it is really a question of preserving in each encounter a sort of positive lawlessness, and, in part, we may do this by acknowledging that each encounter is a new encounter, that there is no ready-made system for projecting ourselves into the future, even just a moment at a time… We pile up knowledge and experience in all of those moments, but nothing is certain… any anarchism worthy of the name is going to be pretty relentlessly suspect of anything that looks like permission or prohibition—both practices which demand some position of authority from which to regulate our encounters in some a priori manner. — Shawn P. Wilbur, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.libertarian-labyrinth.org/contrun/summary-notions/&quot;&gt;“Summary Notions”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we are rejecting any notion of authority above the parties involved in the anarchic encounter itself, and are choosing traditions or other ideas as they are useful to us instead of assuming that we are bound to any of them, then a process of engaging in dialogue is necessary: the free absolutes who meet in an anarchic encounter need to come to a common understanding, and that can only be achieved through language — communication — and the presentation of ‘reasons,’ although traditional conceptions of capital-R rationality need not be the standard. Thus the outcome of any anarchic encounter is ultimately guided by a participatory, dialogical process of offering reasons, justifications, explanations, experiences, perspectives, and desires, all with the explicit purpose not of meeting any standard, but of making oneself understandable to others and finding common ground and mutual understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is through this process of reasoning together, accepting the incommensurability and equal ‘legitimateness’ of other perspectives and then arriving at common ground if possible anyway, that the hopeful, creative nature of the anarchic encounter is born:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let’s underline again this notion of a society without permission or prohibition, and emphasize that all of our anarchic encounters will require something more of us than just asserting our “rights” or fulfilling our “duties” with regard to one another. Every act of association will involve an act of creation, specifically the creation of some bit of some possible world, and creative acts involve some sort of erotics as much as economics. There is a lot that needs to be looked at with regard to how all this creative stuff plays out, but let’s start by saying that none of the familiar language for it—society, community, market, etc.—gets us too far. — Shawn P. Wilbur, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.libertarian-labyrinth.org/contrun/summary-notions/&quot;&gt;“Summary Notions”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is through this notion that a sense of justice as an (in some sense) rational process emerges from a purely egoistic notion of not being willing to subordinate oneself to anything, &lt;em&gt;including&lt;/em&gt; normative accounts of justice or rationality itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this concept of justice has very little positive content — it has as many forms and expressions as there are pairings or groupings of people in existence — but it explicitly provides the form for an anarchic sense of interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I’ve explained the basic concept, there are a few things surrounding it that I want to explore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;equality-and-collectivity&quot;&gt;Equality and Collectivity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For someone used to thinking in terms of the “greater good” or the “public good” — that is, those poisoned by the mythology of utilitarianism, majoritarian democracy, and liberalism, this focus on treating all of the interests of all of the free absolutes (or Uniques, whichever you prefer) that take part in an anarchic encounter as equal, and focusing on the balance between them, might sound similar to the principle of utility. This leads to a possible question: each individual being equal, shouldn’t the greater number of individuals weigh more in a ‘just’ decision than the lesser?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is fundamentally confused for a few basic reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, for a free absolute to submit their will, power, and interests to the will of a greater number is still a submission, still an imposition of duty, obligation, or subordination, a creation of a hierarchy in which the collectivity has greater weight than the individual or smaller collectivity. This is merely a reproduction of the exact sort of thing the anarchic encounter rejects, and is contrary to its preconditions and the nature of the Unique one: collectivity holds no normative weight for such a one, and any attempt to subordinate or obliterate their interests in service to something else, whether it has more people or less, remains an attempt to subordinate them which they will shrug off with a laugh and defend themselves from. Why should I be subject to the interests of another, simply because they have more people backing them? I don’t want to live in a world like that. I don’t want to agree to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, and crucially, justice-as-balance takes place between interests, not between individuals as such. When balancing between the interests of a collectivity and an individual, there are still only two interests at play: the shared collective interest of the former and the singular, but just as real, interest of the latter. If neither side is required to submit, neither by normative dogma nor by force of arms, then the compromise between them must remain balanced. Equal. Equal consideration, compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, collectivities and individuals are different kinds of entities, even if in Proudhon’s thought they are similar in some ways. Just like the set {1,1,1,1,1} would not be equivalent to the number 5, a collectivity is a kind of absolute, but it is not a Unique nor a free absolute. When there is a collectivity that has shared interests, the interests of that group do not count for more than the interests of any individual, because, instead of being rolled up into a single (somehow more “valuable”) composite individual, treating it like a new entity has come into being instead of what it actually is, which is just a composition of individuals who happen to share a certain interest, each member of that group counts singly against the individual. After all, since each member of the group shares an interest, if that interest is favored over the interest of the other individual, each member of that group has also had their interest dominate at the expense of the other person’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Beureaucrats_at_work.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bureaucrats At Work&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this is not a projection of what ‘would’ happen practically speaking, in a sort of ‘state of nature’ vacuum absent anarchist norms or associations or institutions, should the interests of a group come into conflict with an individual — in such a ‘realistic’ case, it might be that the individual would end up just being subordinated to the collectivity, but the point is that that kind of subordination is what we are wishing to avoid, by positing the anarchic encounter as the template for interactions between free people, and so the trick is to be able to identify when what we want happens and when it doesn’t, and try to build structures that resist this sort of ‘state of nature’ attack on the individual. Which leads me to the final section of this essay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion-power-and-justice&quot;&gt;Conclusion: Power and Justice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of this picture of justice-as-balance and the continual, crossing and crisscrossing, ongoing, distributed interaction between free absolutes who compromise and engage in dialogue with each other and create overlapping yet separate collectivities for different purposes and needs, emerges a picture of the social world in which each person asserts their will to power — their innate desire to express themselves, both in their own person, and through impressing their personality and interests on the world around them — and expands the horizon of their &lt;em&gt;property&lt;/em&gt; as far is it will go, until that horizon meets with the horizons of others and they stop at the limits of others’ will to power, bleeding into each other and finding a mutual balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is the nexus where many conceptions of anarchy meet: the eternal social war that Novatore spoke about, where each person is the judge of what they possess; the jovial, sociable, unscrupulous egoism of Stirner’s union; Proudhon’s justice-as-balance and rationality; the aristocratic value of might that Nietzsche brings to the table; and finally everyone’s right to “beautiful, radiant things” that Goldman so desires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can create a social world in which the anarchic encounter is made possible, and in turn gives birth to a social reality in which all of these things turn out to mean the same thing in the end, by decentralizing power as far as possible and balancing force, interests, and incentives, carefully crafting social norms and institutions that foster individuality and the will to power instead of destroying it, and egalitarian cultural habits and levelling mechanism which can maintain all that without giving into rigidity. By doing this, we can help each person seize the power to shape their future both in cooperation and contradistinction to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the ongoing project of anarchism itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to take part in creating a world where the structures and norms that we take part in and perpetuate are &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; in the interest of each of us, because if they are not we reject and resist them; where we have a conception of liberty that means that we are each genuinely motivated, through our own interests, to respect the boundaries of the liberty of the other, because in return we get a substantial, rich, and meaningful respect from them for our own liberty — instead of, for instance, making liberty equivalent to property, so that some gain by this liberty and some sacrifice for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task of anarchism, in other words, is to imagine — not plan, though, because anarchy must necessarily be pluralistic — a society that creates harmony between people by eliminating the tools and incentives for both oppression and submission. We want to do this because, as Tucker says in &lt;a href=&quot;https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/benjamin-tucker-instead-of-a-book#toc5&quot;&gt;“Relation of the State to the Individual”&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If this, then, were a question of right, it would be, according to the Anarchists, purely a question of strength. But, fortunately, it is not a question of right: it is a question of expediency, of knowledge, of science,—the science of living together, the science of society. [A question of what sort of society I would like to live in.] The history of humanity has been largely one long and gradual discovery of the fact that the individual is the gainer by society exactly in proportion as society is free, and of the law that the condition of a permanent and harmonious society is the greatest amount of individual liberty compatible with equality of liberty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think a world in which respecting others leads to a truly equal and meaningful respect for one’s own stands in stark contrast to the relations that we have historically found in Western history, echoes of which we face today: the “reciprocal” relationship of, say, a feudal lord and his serf, or a capitalist and a wage slave.  In each of those bargains, the interests of one with power-over comes to the direct detriment of those they subjugate, even if the bargain is reciprocal in some sense — “you respect my property,” the capitalist says, “and I’ll respect your person… I won’t kill you or (completely) enslave you, but allow you to beg me for scraps from the wealth I gain as a consequence of your respect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is through our collective respect of the property and privilege of our oppressors that they force us to eat scraps from under their table. They own our places of work, our places of play, our homes, and rule over us night and day, leeching off our labor like vampires, and we give them all this for so much less in return. They gain liberty, the liberty to dispose of all this privilege and power, all this wealth and material splendor, at cost to us: our autonomy, our freedom, our very humanity. Yes, they might give us some scraps of respect in return, maybe they promise not to murder us (outright) or give us some wages (a pittance), but the appearance of reciprocity is just that — an appearance, and it is our sacrifice by respecting their liberties that directly leads to our oppression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote &lt;a href=&quot;https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/dr-bones-the-stirner-wasn-t-a-capitalist-you-fucking-idiot-cheat-sheet&quot;&gt;Stirner&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By what then is your property secure, you creatures of preferment? — and give themselves the answer, By our refraining from interference! And so by our protection! And what do you give us for it? Kicks and disdain you give to the “common people”; police supervision, and a catechism with the chief sentence “Respect what is not yours, what belongs to others! respect others, and especially your superiors!” But we reply, “If you want our respect, buy it for a price agreeable to us. We will leave you your property, if you give a due equivalent for this leaving.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Really, what equivalent does the general in time of peace give for the many thousands of his yearly income.? — another for the sheer hundred-thousands and millions yearly? What equivalent do you give for our chewing potatoes and looking calmly on while you swallow oysters? Only buy the oysters of us as dear as we have to buy the potatoes of you, then you may go on eating them.Or do you suppose the oysters do not belong to us as much as to you? You will make an outcry over violence if we reach out our hands and help consume them, and you are right. Without violence we do not get them, as you no less have them by doing violence to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrast this with what would necessarily result from a widespread, stalwart refusal to obey, respect, acquiesce, and a vigorous defense of ourselves and our fellows in doing so, not just civil disobedience. Consider the results of truly accepting justice-as-balance and our place as Unique ones over whom no fixed idea or authority can be acknowledged. Consider, in other words, the fruit of insurrection, the ringing shout of “No!” that justice leads us to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anarchistic justice cries this, and only this: do not respect anything or anyone that does not respect you in return. They have not earned it!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it benefits you, by all means protect it, participate in it, defend it, enjoy it! Mutual aid, solidarity, norms of respecting individual possessions or commons, whatever it is…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as soon as it stops serving you, cast it aside — what more interest in it do you have?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capitalists’ claims to property oppress you? Break their machines, steal ‘their’ products, which you made, occupy their land. The law oppresses you? What is the law to you, really? Fuck it. Nothing can command you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say again: &lt;strong&gt;if a person or system does not respect your interests and your equality to it, then do not respect it either, because it has not earned that respect. Participate in what benefits you and reject what does not.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A widespread elaboration of this attitude is precisely the insurrectionary, criminal anarchism that I support, which would lead, through a world of anarchic encounters, to norms and institutions that, of necessity, benefit everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A constant, ongoing battle against those who would exploit us or dominate us, that is anarchism.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron’s cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult. To be “cured” against one’s will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those who never will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and domestic animals. — C.S. Lewis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although he himself certainly did not apply the ideas contained in this quote consistently, and while this was more likely a case of a monkey, when put at a typewriter long enough, having an inevitable chance of producing something good, I think that this quote represents, in encapsulated form, why anarchism is so important. In that, it is probably the only C.S. Lewis quote that I will ever agree with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anarchism is most often defined by what it opposes: hierarchy, authority, and all other forms of domination. This is important in itself, crucial even, since this opposition is what makes anarchism the most radical, consistent, and liberatory movement that we have - the only one that truly offers an alternative to life as humanity has lived it, with all its pain, alienation, and violence, for thousands of years. The only one that doesn’t ultimately just boil down to a sacrifice of the self on the altar of a sacred idea or just to another person or class of people. Yet, this opposition is so staunch and far-reaching, so through-going, that it in itself acts as the negative image of a picture of what anarchism stands &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;individual autonomy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/speech-on-the-passions-of-love.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Speech on the Passions of Love, by Guy Debord&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This essay could never be a comprehensive account of what autonomy is, so I won’t attempt that and I’m going to tell you beforehand not to expect it. Autonomy is an intensely subjective and first-person experience of one’s relationship with the material world and the social realities one finds oneself in; as such, it has complex social, cultural, historical, psychological, economic and political dimensions that give it too wide a breadth as a concept to be summed up in essentialist “necessary and sufficient conditions.” Nevertheless I will attempt to give a useful sketch of the important features of the experience and properties of autonomy, so that I can more accurately explain why it is so important to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-autonomy&quot;&gt;What Is Autonomy?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first definition of “autonomy” in the Oxford English Dictionary is: “the right or condition of self-government,” specifically in the context of political bodies, nations, and states. This is not the sense in which I mean it - autonomy defined this way is almost meaningless for the egoist, the individual who must live, act, make choices, and interact with others and the systems of power within which they find themselves every day. Yet, there is perhaps an aspect of correctness to this definition: when applied to individuals, instead of polities, it stands for something like: the ability to direct one’s own affairs and activities according to one’s own plan, without outside control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This definition is still imperfect, however, even taken as a vague sketch, to be used as an archetype in a non-essentialist fashion. The use of the word “government” here carries shades of the second definition in that same entry: “the capacity of an agent to act in accordance with objective morality rather than under the influence of desires” - viewing the individual’s life and desires as something to be channeled into certain directions and not others, to be restrained and converted from a raging flood of passion and self-enjoyment into a strict and well controlled canal; in other words, to be “governed.” The only difference is that instead of the individual being governed by something outside of themselves, they choose to govern themselves voluntarily, which is hardly better and very little different - still a subjugation to sacred ideas and absolutes which ultimately come from without.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since these definitions aren’t adequate, something else is needed. To fully encapsulate the idea that I use the word “autonomy” to evoke, I need to bring in two further psychological concepts: self-determination and self-actualization. Both of these concepts, intertwined and mixed together, interlocked in all the ways that they naturally touch in our real lives, are vitally important components of what autonomy means as a holistic subjective state for an individual to be in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-determination is the ability to choose the path one follows in life, to guide the direction one’s life takes and have control over the important things in one’s life. Self-determination implies both control of one’s own actions and body in a strict sense, and a more general control of or at least substantial influence over the social and material context within which one exists. Think about it - if all I can control is my own body and actions, but I have no control over my food, shelter, and other material needs, including the things I need to feel happy and fulfilled in life, in what way can I be said to have control over, or even input in, the direction of my own life? Likewise, if I can’t decide who I associate with and who I do not, in what sense can my life be said to be determined by my desires? Obviously perfect control over these things is impossible, the vagaries of random chance and the autonomy of others makes that impossible, but there is most certainly a scale of varying amounts of self-determination, and as those who have very little or very much will tell you, where you fall on that scale matters. A lot. What matters most is &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; has control over your life if you don’t: is it just that the reality is sometimes life happens and things don’t go your way, is it just chance and normal happenstance and other people’s personal choices that are causing you to not have control over your life - or is it someone with actual power over you to determine what happens in your life according to their will?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/migrants.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Northeastern Migrants by João Musa&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-actualization, on the other hand, is the ability to fulfill all your potentialities and capacities - to learn the skills you want to learn and exercise them to the fullest, to be able to make do and build and make and achieve things that are meaningful to you according to the inclinations and interests that you have, to develop new interests and leave behind old ones as you develop, to express yourself how you want to express yourself in speech, clothing, social relationships, and even (or especially) your body itself, and to have the space to experiment with that expression and change it as you change. It is the ability to grow and develop and strengthen and exercise and change and develop and learn and revise and discard and add all the parts of who you are, from your identity to your skills, as befits the growing, changing, fluid &lt;a href=&quot;https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/castanea-dentata-some-thoughts-on-the-creative-nothing-2&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;creative nothings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Uniques, that we are. Self-actualization should be separated carefully from the sort of reified, static conception of the self, with its particular and constant limits and abilities and inclinations, and its static identity and means of expressing itself, that we see in some quarters - originating in Aristotalian eudaimonism, with its emphasis on actualizing yourself as an instantiation of a sacred idea of “the human” before which you should slice off any of your offending uniqueness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-is-autonomy-so-important&quot;&gt;Why Is Autonomy So Important?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can probably see by now, in a sense these two things are two sides of the same coin. Without self-determination, self-actualization is hardly really possible, since one will be constantly buffeted about by the winds of fate and the whims of those who hold power over your life; without self-actualization, self-determination is a meaningless pursuit of stability, order, comfort, conformity, and mere survival. To have a truly rich, complex, and beautiful life, one must have both. To quote Novatore, the great individualist anarchist who synthesized Stirner and Nietzsche in his poetic writings, “I have understood life. And anyone who understands life cannot live on [their] knees.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/ascention.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Human Ascension&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While others might be content to sacrifice their autonomy to others in one way or another in return for imagined safety and security, I am not so inclined, and I most certainly do not believe that others have any moral right to force me to do the same. Have your ill-advised “social contracts” - but leave me out of it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sacrifice my autonomy to some authority over me is to put my life in their hands: at the mercy of their morality, their interests, their beliefs about reality, their mistakes, and their blindness to my lived experience, my values, and my situation. Autonomy is the prerequisite for having any interests at all, because only when we have it can we be guaranteed the ability to pursue whatever interests us, and only what interests us. To the degree that we give it up, and grant others power over us, we lose our ability to pursue our own interests; insofar as we find that we still can, it is at the mercy of, and with permission from, those who hold our puppet-strings. Ultimately, when you put yourself under someone’s authority, you place some or all of your interests at their feet. What serves them is what you will get, and it is all that you will get. To quote Novatore again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Rather I despise beggars, misers, all those who don’t dare to fight, but who only know how to beg and weep.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;They are the ones who beg for fallen crumbs from the sumptuous table of my enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But what could these misers ever gain from the victory over me brought back by my enemy, i.e., by their master? Nothing more that the usual crumbs and eternal slavery!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s explore this more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps my would-be masters promise to look out for my interests - and let us assume that they are genuine. Can they really know them as well as I do? If they cannot comprehend the situation you’re in and the experiences you have, cannot imagine the needs you have, how can they? Can the moral busybody who judges a homeless person for self-medicating with drugs or alcohol, or the concerned parents who cannot imagine it actually being in their child’s best interest to transition, or the doctor who insists that this or that medication is the right one for you when you know the side effects are worse, for you, than the benefits, or the FDA official who decides that a treatment is too risky to be allowed, when the alternative for people suffering from whatever disease it’s meant to treat may just be death, actually look out for your interests?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What matters to someone varies wildly from person to person. Values differ, understandings of self and identity differ. There is no enshrined human nature that ensures that, at the core of every person’s being, the same desires hold sway. Can others know your innermost mind and the desires that spring from it, when you yourself must often discover them through trial and error, through having room to explore and experiment? When they are changeable, when identity and desire and interest are not fixed entities, a static tablet of What Is Good For You, perhaps shared in some abstract “human nature,” but spring from the eternally shifting and flowing river of your creative nothing? The only person who has full knowledge of your situation, your needs, and, most importantly, the values that are unique and specific to you, is &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;. Listen to other people’s advice, if you wish; they may have more insight into the practical, factual nature of certain things than you do, but remain always aware that what is important is what works for you. Experiment, assess the risks and boldly choose them. Because those who give you advice also may not know what will work for you better than you do: even supposedly non-exceptional cases can have unique variables because no human being, and no human being’s situation, is identical to another; so do not leave the decision of whether you follow that advice up to them. Experts should be treated as people to consult with, not technocratic priests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because when you submit yourself to the authorities so that they can protect you and choose what is best for you, all your options disappear. Whether they are right or wrong - something which you will feel most acutely, and which will at best be a distant warning signal to them, often swept away in their certainty in their rightness - you are committed to the course; they have you in hand, and they will have their way with you. If they care about what you actually value, your values may still diverge; often as not, however, when others accept authority over you in order to help you, it is in order to help you achieve what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; would want, or what they believe the best state to be in is, and they care little for what you &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; want. You may be wrong about what you actually want, you may be short-sighted, but that just means you need room to experiment and time to learn and grow; how would they know what is best of all for you? If they believe their kind of thinking is the best kind of thinking, they will label yours insanity and confine you to the madhouse. If they believe that their kind of life - cisgender, heteronormative, allosexual, neurotypical, whatever - is the best kind of life to live, they will “cure” you of those undesirable states which prevent you from living it. Or try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/sedation.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sedation by Jacob Lawrence&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is it common for those who accept authority over you “for your own good” to be more interested in inflicting their ideas of what constitutes a good life on you? Because that is pretty much required to accept such a position in the first place. If they were interested in listening to what you wanted and focusing on enacting your agency and helping you live well, they wouldn’t be an authority, they’d be a comrade, an ally, a friend. To assume authority over you they have to be less interested in what you actually want, in facilitating you, than they are in their certainty that their own ruling ideas, their own sacred fixed phantoms, are what “should be.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, losing your autonomy robs you of your growth, your flourishing as a human individual. An autonomous individual may make mistakes and get themselves hurt, but their journey is their own, and they are able to find out for themselves what life they want to lead and live it. Each choice they make is chosen for themselves, and they feel responsible for it, they truly learn from it, they internalize it. When an autonomous person makes a right choice it is their own and represents development and growth; when they make a wrong choice, that, too, represents development and growth. But when you are forced to make the right choice - if it even is right - you don’t learn or grow from it. You resent it and resist it. Or you are beaten down and broken until you don’t care anymore and just want to obey. Without room to learn, grow, experiment, make mistakes, to learn for oneself what is and is not your own, you cannot develop into a full, whole human being. You will forever be a subsidiary to someone else, because you will always be dependent on them to make decisions for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The horrors of “we just want what’s best for you” are too many to number and too visceral to explain. At this point my words fail me, as they must, and if you are not already convinced, or at least sympathetic, I can only gesture helplessly and ask you to consciously choose to engage your imagination, your empathy, to consult stories both real and imagined as aids. If you already live a life so completely unremarkable, so “normal,” that having the common idea of what the proper, happy human life is imposed on you holds no teeth, perhaps all that I’ve said so far will bear little weight for you. I can’t help that. I’ve done what I can with what are, in the end, weak tools compared to personal experience, even just the experience of staring into that abyss of self-annihilation that becoming the puppet of someone else’s ideal human life represents. Rationality isn’t all it’s cracked up to be; “all rational people” are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; guaranteed to all arrive at the same conclusions, because what is rational is influenced by what methods of reasoning we comprehend and what premises we already believe. Those things, in turn, are determined by your life experiences, and sometimes - even most of the time - life experiences can’t be communicated, can’t be summed up in surveys and meta-analyses or even in personal stories; at least, not in a way that will actually convince someone else that those experiences are “true.” So sometimes, you can say something that’s completely true, based on the intimate factual phenomenological experience that you have available to you - such as the fact that a loss of autonomy is deeply, deeply psychologically harmful - and you simply will not be able to convince someone who refuses to be convinced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/thestatehospital.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The State Hospital by Edward Kienholz&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes,” a concerned, compassionate, helpful, moral, kind, sincere reader might object, “forcing someone to do something for their own good might be beneficial.” Must we give up every instance of helpful intervention? Surely we can keep some and discard others!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this I have two responses. First - how are you so sure that those “interventions” are actually good, except by assuming that all of my foregoing critique is wrong, and you truly can know what is best for others? That everyone is fundamentally the same in their values and what they want out of life, and that you can determine what’s good for them beforehand. Otherwise, how do you establish before the fact that your beloved intervention will be for the best? You can’t wait till after, to hear the praise and confirmation of the person you helped - causation does not flow backwards at your convenience. Pointing at studies and statistics will only demonstrate that many people found an intervention helpful, at best, and most of the time will only demonstrate that that intervention is useful at achieving a certain outcome, which your target may or may not actually value. Only by asking, and listening to the answer you get, can you have a complete picture of whether an intervention will help - and even then, someone might not be able to communicate the full weight of their situation and desires to you well enough to rationally convince you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second - all interventions for the good of another follow the same logic: you have an idea of what constitutes a happy human life, and you enforce it on others. There is no principled difference between one and another; even the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; intervention can be helpful or harmful for different people. If you choose to allow the one, you allow them all. If you disallow one, you must disallow them all. I trust people to choose their own lives and live them, to arrange their relations and activities as they need to. Do you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let us stop assuming that those who accept authority over us genuinely want “what is best for us,” or that we, as individuals, actually get a choice in whether anyone has authority over us. That is a naive dream, the thought of an indoctrinated child, not of an adult who has seen the world we really live in and interacted with the people who live in it. It grants far too much to Authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the real world, in many areas of our lives, we don’t even really get a &lt;em&gt;choice&lt;/em&gt; about whether to give up our autonomy or not. That choice, perhaps the most important choice conceivable, is already made for us. There is, of course, some sense in which, in the aggregate, the people who are dominated “grant” power to the authority that is held over them, because any wide-spread and consistent insurrection would render coercive authority powerless in the long run, but practically speaking most of the authorities that we find ourselves subject to throughout our lives - capitalists, bosses, police, politicians - find themselves there through sheer violence. Oh, there might be stories that they tell to explain why what they do is acceptable - the greater good, the social contract, the horrors of the “state of nature” - but ultimately we do what they ask us to do because we fear the consequences. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.alexisdumas.org/2022/05/13/fuck-the-state.html&quot;&gt;There was never any &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; choice for any particular individual subjected to their power&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that it doesn’t matter what we want or think, whether we change our minds or whether the system keeps working in our favor. We will be subjected to it, whether we want to be or not, unless we stage a full scale insurrection against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This demonstrates a general point, as well, one which applies to any authority you are considering calling legitimate and submitting yourself to: submitting to an authority opens one up to exploitation. Once you’ve done it, once you’ve given them that power, they are free to exploit you and terrorize you to whatever degree you grant them authority, to whatever degree they control the important parts of your life. This is why endorsing systems that grant others power and authority over you is so dangerous, why having one’s autonomy from others is so crucial. If the alternative you are presented with because of those systems of power is starvation and homelessness, they can make your life so miserable it’s &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; short of that abject misery; if the alternative is death, well, there’s a very long way they can go. A very, very long way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/poor.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Poor People At the Seashore by Picasso&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-this-mean&quot;&gt;What Does This Mean?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not act perfectly free, then? If autonomy is the “most important thing” then why not just ignore all the laws and face the consequences? Because I might gain some autonomy in the short run, but I would lose it that much more in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measure of whether a choice was voluntarily chosen or not is in the acceptability of the alternatives - especially in what autonomy remains to you if you choose those alternatives. As Sartre said, in any situation you find yourself in, even in jail or on the torture rack, or with a gun to your head, you are “free”: ultimately, you make all the choices for your actions. But can any of that really be called freedom in a meaningful sense? If my choice is between submitting to the will of another and death, all my options are blocked off: if I choose death, I am dead - no more choices, no more life, no more autonomy or growth, it is the ultimate nullification of my self-determination. So it is as if I am presented with a fork in the road, and one fork immediately ends in a wall, while the other gets narrower but leads on for an unknown distance. I could choose to go down the blocked path and just expire at the wall. Or I could choose the only choice that leaves me with any further choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/exercising.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Prisoners Exercising by Picasso&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the degree, thus, that I choose to obey the law, it is because the risk of a loss of my autonomy that the alternative presents is unacceptable to me. I sacrifice autonomy to remain autonomous. Perhaps I don’t act that out perfectly consistently - but some allowance must be made for cowardice. I am not Novatore, willing to live my life in the mountains, on the run from police. That, itself, seems like a restriction of my choices just as much as mostly following the law does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autonomy is not the only value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not telling you what you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; want or &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; do - I am merely explaining, as best I can, why I value what I value, why I don’t want to live in a world where I must sacrifice my autonomy to people, ideas, systems, or institutions, or in order to obtain other pleasures in life, in the hopes that, through my rhetoric and reasoning, I can make some connection with your own lived experiences and find common ground, common cause, a shared ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main thrust of my anarchism is that I don’t want to have to choose between a comfortable or pleasurable or joyful life, and autonomy, freedom, liberty - because both are valuable to me. I am not a stoic or a puritan, I enjoy all the things live has to offer, so to be forced to choose between the fruits of a pleasurable life and the struggle of self-improvement and self-responsibility is disgusting to me. I don’t want to cast aside either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This essay is an expression of why I love autonomy, because everyone loves pleasure. By extension it is an expression of why I am an egoist anarchist. You can either join me, or go your own way. If you choose to go your own way, consciously, as an egoist, I won’t demean you, even if you become my enemy. If you choose autonomy, perhaps we can meet someday, and find mutual enjoyment in each other’s company. But if you choose to reject autonomy, both material and intellectual, then I can only echo Novatore and tell you to get away from me - I don’t wish to be associated with rabble.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alexis Purslane</name></author><category term="anarchism" /><category term="egoism" /><category term="ethics" /><summary type="html">Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive.
