  &lt;p&gt;Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron’s cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult. To be “cured” against one’s will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those who never will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and domestic animals. — C.S. Lewis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although he himself certainly did not apply the ideas contained in this quote consistently, and while this was more likely a case of a monkey, when put at a typewriter long enough, having an inevitable chance of producing something good, I think that this quote represents, in encapsulated form, why anarchism is so important. In that, it is probably the only C.S. Lewis quote that I will ever agree with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anarchism is most often defined by what it opposes: hierarchy, authority, and all other forms of domination. This is important in itself, crucial even, since this opposition is what makes anarchism the most radical, consistent, and liberatory movement that we have - the only one that truly offers an alternative to life as humanity has lived it, with all its pain, alienation, and violence, for thousands of years. The only one that doesn’t ultimately just boil down to a sacrifice of the self on the altar of a sacred idea or just to another person or class of people. Yet, this opposition is so staunch and far-reaching, so through-going, that it in itself acts as the negative image of a picture of what anarchism stands &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;individual autonomy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/speech-on-the-passions-of-love.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Speech on the Passions of Love, by Guy Debord&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This essay could never be a comprehensive account of what autonomy is, so I won’t attempt that and I’m going to tell you beforehand not to expect it. Autonomy is an intensely subjective and first-person experience of one’s relationship with the material world and the social realities one finds oneself in; as such, it has complex social, cultural, historical, psychological, economic and political dimensions that give it too wide a breadth as a concept to be summed up in essentialist “necessary and sufficient conditions.” Nevertheless I will attempt to give a useful sketch of the important features of the experience and properties of autonomy, so that I can more accurately explain why it is so important to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-autonomy&quot;&gt;What Is Autonomy?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first definition of “autonomy” in the Oxford English Dictionary is: “the right or condition of self-government,” specifically in the context of political bodies, nations, and states. This is not the sense in which I mean it - autonomy defined this way is almost meaningless for the egoist, the individual who must live, act, make choices, and interact with others and the systems of power within which they find themselves every day. Yet, there is perhaps an aspect of correctness to this definition: when applied to individuals, instead of polities, it stands for something like: the ability to direct one’s own affairs and activities according to one’s own plan, without outside control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This definition is still imperfect, however, even taken as a vague sketch, to be used as an archetype in a non-essentialist fashion. The use of the word “government” here carries shades of the second definition in that same entry: “the capacity of an agent to act in accordance with objective morality rather than under the influence of desires” - viewing the individual’s life and desires as something to be channeled into certain directions and not others, to be restrained and converted from a raging flood of passion and self-enjoyment into a strict and well controlled canal; in other words, to be “governed.” The only difference is that instead of the individual being governed by something outside of themselves, they choose to govern themselves voluntarily, which is hardly better and very little different - still a subjugation to sacred ideas and absolutes which ultimately come from without.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since these definitions aren’t adequate, something else is needed. To fully encapsulate the idea that I use the word “autonomy” to evoke, I need to bring in two further psychological concepts: self-determination and self-actualization. Both of these concepts, intertwined and mixed together, interlocked in all the ways that they naturally touch in our real lives, are vitally important components of what autonomy means as a holistic subjective state for an individual to be in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-determination is the ability to choose the path one follows in life, to guide the direction one’s life takes and have control over the important things in one’s life. Self-determination implies both control of one’s own actions and body in a strict sense, and a more general control of or at least substantial influence over the social and material context within which one exists. Think about it - if all I can control is my own body and actions, but I have no control over my food, shelter, and other material needs, including the things I need to feel happy and fulfilled in life, in what way can I be said to have control over, or even input in, the direction of my own life? Likewise, if I can’t decide who I associate with and who I do not, in what sense can my life be said to be determined by my desires? Obviously perfect control over these things is impossible, the vagaries of random chance and the autonomy of others makes that impossible, but there is most certainly a scale of varying amounts of self-determination, and as those who have very little or very much will tell you, where you fall on that scale matters. A lot. What matters most is &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; has control over your life if you don’t: is it just that the reality is sometimes life happens and things don’t go your way, is it just chance and normal happenstance and other people’s personal choices that are causing you to not have control over your life - or is it someone with actual power over you to determine what happens in your life according to their will?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/migrants.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Northeastern Migrants by João Musa&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-actualization, on the other hand, is the ability to fulfill all your potentialities and capacities - to learn the skills you want to learn and exercise them to the fullest, to be able to make do and build and make and achieve things that are meaningful to you according to the inclinations and interests that you have, to develop new interests and leave behind old ones as you develop, to express yourself how you want to express yourself in speech, clothing, social relationships, and even (or especially) your body itself, and to have the space to experiment with that expression and change it as you change. It is the ability to grow and develop and strengthen and exercise and change and develop and learn and revise and discard and add all the parts of who you are, from your identity to your skills, as befits the growing, changing, fluid &lt;a href=&quot;https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/castanea-dentata-some-thoughts-on-the-creative-nothing-2&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;creative nothings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Uniques, that we are. Self-actualization should be separated carefully from the sort of reified, static conception of the self, with its particular and constant limits and abilities and inclinations, and its static identity and means of expressing itself, that we see in some quarters - originating in Aristotalian eudaimonism, with its emphasis on actualizing yourself as an instantiation of a sacred idea of “the human” before which you should slice off any of your offending uniqueness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-is-autonomy-so-important&quot;&gt;Why Is Autonomy So Important?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can probably see by now, in a sense these two things are two sides of the same coin. Without self-determination, self-actualization is hardly really possible, since one will be constantly buffeted about by the winds of fate and the whims of those who hold power over your life; without self-actualization, self-determination is a meaningless pursuit of stability, order, comfort, conformity, and mere survival. To have a truly rich, complex, and beautiful life, one must have both. To quote Novatore, the great individualist anarchist who synthesized Stirner and Nietzsche in his poetic writings, “I have understood life. And anyone who understands life cannot live on [their] knees.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/ascention.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Human Ascension&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While others might be content to sacrifice their autonomy to others in one way or another in return for imagined safety and security, I am not so inclined, and I most certainly do not believe that others have any moral right to force me to do the same. Have your ill-advised “social contracts” - but leave me out of it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sacrifice my autonomy to some authority over me is to put my life in their hands: at the mercy of their morality, their interests, their beliefs about reality, their mistakes, and their blindness to my lived experience, my values, and my situation. Autonomy is the prerequisite for having any interests at all, because only when we have it can we be guaranteed the ability to pursue whatever interests us, and only what interests us. To the degree that we give it up, and grant others power over us, we lose our ability to pursue our own interests; insofar as we find that we still can, it is at the mercy of, and with permission from, those who hold our puppet-strings. Ultimately, when you put yourself under someone’s authority, you place some or all of your interests at their feet. What serves them is what you will get, and it is all that you will get. To quote Novatore again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Rather I despise beggars, misers, all those who don’t dare to fight, but who only know how to beg and weep.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;They are the ones who beg for fallen crumbs from the sumptuous table of my enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But what could these misers ever gain from the victory over me brought back by my enemy, i.e., by their master? Nothing more that the usual crumbs and eternal slavery!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s explore this more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps my would-be masters promise to look out for my interests - and let us assume that they are genuine. Can they really know them as well as I do? If they cannot comprehend the situation you’re in and the experiences you have, cannot imagine the needs you have, how can they? Can the moral busybody who judges a homeless person for self-medicating with drugs or alcohol, or the concerned parents who cannot imagine it actually being in their child’s best interest to transition, or the doctor who insists that this or that medication is the right one for you when you know the side effects are worse, for you, than the benefits, or the FDA official who decides that a treatment is too risky to be allowed, when the alternative for people suffering from whatever disease it’s meant to treat may just be death, actually look out for your interests?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What matters to someone varies wildly from person to person. Values differ, understandings of self and identity differ. There is no enshrined human nature that ensures that, at the core of every person’s being, the same desires hold sway. Can others know your innermost mind and the desires that spring from it, when you yourself must often discover them through trial and error, through having room to explore and experiment? When they are changeable, when identity and desire and interest are not fixed entities, a static tablet of What Is Good For You, perhaps shared in some abstract “human nature,” but spring from the eternally shifting and flowing river of your creative nothing? The only person who has full knowledge of your situation, your needs, and, most importantly, the values that are unique and specific to you, is &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;. Listen to other people’s advice, if you wish; they may have more insight into the practical, factual nature of certain things than you do, but remain always aware that what is important is what works for you. Experiment, assess the risks and boldly choose them. Because those who give you advice also may not know what will work for you better than you do: even supposedly non-exceptional cases can have unique variables because no human being, and no human being’s situation, is identical to another; so do not leave the decision of whether you follow that advice up to them. Experts should be treated as people to consult with, not technocratic priests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because when you submit yourself to the authorities so that they can protect you and choose what is best for you, all your options disappear. Whether they are right or wrong - something which you will feel most acutely, and which will at best be a distant warning signal to them, often swept away in their certainty in their rightness - you are committed to the course; they have you in hand, and they will have their way with you. If they care about what you actually value, your values may still diverge; often as not, however, when others accept authority over you in order to help you, it is in order to help you achieve what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; would want, or what they believe the best state to be in is, and they care little for what you &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; want. You may be wrong about what you actually want, you may be short-sighted, but that just means you need room to experiment and time to learn and grow; how would they know what is best of all for you? If they believe their kind of thinking is the best kind of thinking, they will label yours insanity and confine you to the madhouse. If they believe that their kind of life - cisgender, heteronormative, allosexual, neurotypical, whatever - is the best kind of life to live, they will “cure” you of those undesirable states which prevent you from living it. Or try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/sedation.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sedation by Jacob Lawrence&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is it common for those who accept authority over you “for your own good” to be more interested in inflicting their ideas of what constitutes a good life on you? Because that is pretty much required to accept such a position in the first place. If they were interested in listening to what you wanted and focusing on enacting your agency and helping you live well, they wouldn’t be an authority, they’d be a comrade, an ally, a friend. To assume authority over you they have to be less interested in what you actually want, in facilitating you, than they are in their certainty that their own ruling ideas, their own sacred fixed phantoms, are what “should be.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, losing your autonomy robs you of your growth, your flourishing as a human individual. An autonomous individual may make mistakes and get themselves hurt, but their journey is their own, and they are able to find out for themselves what life they want to lead and live it. Each choice they make is chosen for themselves, and they feel responsible for it, they truly learn from it, they internalize it. When an autonomous person makes a right choice it is their own and represents development and growth; when they make a wrong choice, that, too, represents development and growth. But when you are forced to make the right choice - if it even is right - you don’t learn or grow from it. You resent it and resist it. Or you are beaten down and broken until you don’t care anymore and just want to obey. Without room to learn, grow, experiment, make mistakes, to learn for oneself what is and is not your own, you cannot develop into a full, whole human being. You will forever be a subsidiary to someone else, because you will always be dependent on them to make decisions for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The horrors of “we just want what’s best for you” are too many to number and too visceral to explain. At this point my words fail me, as they must, and if you are not already convinced, or at least sympathetic, I can only gesture helplessly and ask you to consciously choose to engage your imagination, your empathy, to consult stories both real and imagined as aids. If you already live a life so completely unremarkable, so “normal,” that having the common idea of what the proper, happy human life is imposed on you holds no teeth, perhaps all that I’ve said so far will bear little weight for you. I can’t help that. I’ve done what I can with what are, in the end, weak tools compared to personal experience, even just the experience of staring into that abyss of self-annihilation that becoming the puppet of someone else’s ideal human life represents. Rationality isn’t all it’s cracked up to be; “all rational people” are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; guaranteed to all arrive at the same conclusions, because what is rational is influenced by what methods of reasoning we comprehend and what premises we already believe. Those things, in turn, are determined by your life experiences, and sometimes - even most of the time - life experiences can’t be communicated, can’t be summed up in surveys and meta-analyses or even in personal stories; at least, not in a way that will actually convince someone else that those experiences are “true.” So sometimes, you can say something that’s completely true, based on the intimate factual phenomenological experience that you have available to you - such as the fact that a loss of autonomy is deeply, deeply psychologically harmful - and you simply will not be able to convince someone who refuses to be convinced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/thestatehospital.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The State Hospital by Edward Kienholz&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes,” a concerned, compassionate, helpful, moral, kind, sincere reader might object, “forcing someone to do something for their own good might be beneficial.” Must we give up every instance of helpful intervention? Surely we can keep some and discard others!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this I have two responses. First - how are you so sure that those “interventions” are actually good, except by assuming that all of my foregoing critique is wrong, and you truly can know what is best for others? That everyone is fundamentally the same in their values and what they want out of life, and that you can determine what’s good for them beforehand. Otherwise, how do you establish before the fact that your beloved intervention will be for the best? You can’t wait till after, to hear the praise and confirmation of the person you helped - causation does not flow backwards at your convenience. Pointing at studies and statistics will only demonstrate that many people found an intervention helpful, at best, and most of the time will only demonstrate that that intervention is useful at achieving a certain outcome, which your target may or may not actually value. Only by asking, and listening to the answer you get, can you have a complete picture of whether an intervention will help - and even then, someone might not be able to communicate the full weight of their situation and desires to you well enough to rationally convince you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second - all interventions for the good of another follow the same logic: you have an idea of what constitutes a happy human life, and you enforce it on others. There is no principled difference between one and another; even the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; intervention can be helpful or harmful for different people. If you choose to allow the one, you allow them all. If you disallow one, you must disallow them all. I trust people to choose their own lives and live them, to arrange their relations and activities as they need to. Do you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let us stop assuming that those who accept authority over us genuinely want “what is best for us,” or that we, as individuals, actually get a choice in whether anyone has authority over us. That is a naive dream, the thought of an indoctrinated child, not of an adult who has seen the world we really live in and interacted with the people who live in it. It grants far too much to Authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the real world, in many areas of our lives, we don’t even really get a &lt;em&gt;choice&lt;/em&gt; about whether to give up our autonomy or not. That choice, perhaps the most important choice conceivable, is already made for us. There is, of course, some sense in which, in the aggregate, the people who are dominated “grant” power to the authority that is held over them, because any wide-spread and consistent insurrection would render coercive authority powerless in the long run, but practically speaking most of the authorities that we find ourselves subject to throughout our lives - capitalists, bosses, police, politicians - find themselves there through sheer violence. Oh, there might be stories that they tell to explain why what they do is acceptable - the greater good, the social contract, the horrors of the “state of nature” - but ultimately we do what they ask us to do because we fear the consequences. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.alexisdumas.org/2022/05/13/fuck-the-state.html&quot;&gt;There was never any &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; choice for any particular individual subjected to their power&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that it doesn’t matter what we want or think, whether we change our minds or whether the system keeps working in our favor. We will be subjected to it, whether we want to be or not, unless we stage a full scale insurrection against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This demonstrates a general point, as well, one which applies to any authority you are considering calling legitimate and submitting yourself to: submitting to an authority opens one up to exploitation. Once you’ve done it, once you’ve given them that power, they are free to exploit you and terrorize you to whatever degree you grant them authority, to whatever degree they control the important parts of your life. This is why endorsing systems that grant others power and authority over you is so dangerous, why having one’s autonomy from others is so crucial. If the alternative you are presented with because of those systems of power is starvation and homelessness, they can make your life so miserable it’s &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; short of that abject misery; if the alternative is death, well, there’s a very long way they can go. A very, very long way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/poor.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Poor People At the Seashore by Picasso&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-this-mean&quot;&gt;What Does This Mean?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not act perfectly free, then? If autonomy is the “most important thing” then why not just ignore all the laws and face the consequences? Because I might gain some autonomy in the short run, but I would lose it that much more in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measure of whether a choice was voluntarily chosen or not is in the acceptability of the alternatives - especially in what autonomy remains to you if you choose those alternatives. As Sartre said, in any situation you find yourself in, even in jail or on the torture rack, or with a gun to your head, you are “free”: ultimately, you make all the choices for your actions. But can any of that really be called freedom in a meaningful sense? If my choice is between submitting to the will of another and death, all my options are blocked off: if I choose death, I am dead - no more choices, no more life, no more autonomy or growth, it is the ultimate nullification of my self-determination. So it is as if I am presented with a fork in the road, and one fork immediately ends in a wall, while the other gets narrower but leads on for an unknown distance. I could choose to go down the blocked path and just expire at the wall. Or I could choose the only choice that leaves me with any further choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/exercising.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Prisoners Exercising by Picasso&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the degree, thus, that I choose to obey the law, it is because the risk of a loss of my autonomy that the alternative presents is unacceptable to me. I sacrifice autonomy to remain autonomous. Perhaps I don’t act that out perfectly consistently - but some allowance must be made for cowardice. I am not Novatore, willing to live my life in the mountains, on the run from police. That, itself, seems like a restriction of my choices just as much as mostly following the law does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autonomy is not the only value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not telling you what you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; want or &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; do - I am merely explaining, as best I can, why I value what I value, why I don’t want to live in a world where I must sacrifice my autonomy to people, ideas, systems, or institutions, or in order to obtain other pleasures in life, in the hopes that, through my rhetoric and reasoning, I can make some connection with your own lived experiences and find common ground, common cause, a shared ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main thrust of my anarchism is that I don’t want to have to choose between a comfortable or pleasurable or joyful life, and autonomy, freedom, liberty - because both are valuable to me. I am not a stoic or a puritan, I enjoy all the things live has to offer, so to be forced to choose between the fruits of a pleasurable life and the struggle of self-improvement and self-responsibility is disgusting to me. I don’t want to cast aside either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This essay is an expression of why I love autonomy, because everyone loves pleasure. By extension it is an expression of why I am an egoist anarchist. You can either join me, or go your own way. If you choose to go your own way, consciously, as an egoist, I won’t demean you, even if you become my enemy. If you choose autonomy, perhaps we can meet someday, and find mutual enjoyment in each other’s company. But if you choose to reject autonomy, both material and intellectual, then I can only echo Novatore and tell you to get away from me - I don’t wish to be associated with rabble.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alexis Purslane</name></author><category term="anarchism" /><category term="egoism" /><category term="ethics" /><summary type="html">Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive.

  &lt;p&gt;God, the State, Society, Humanity, etc., etc. have their own cause for themselves. If I don’t want to subjugate myself God’s cause, I am a “sinner”. If I don’t want to submit to the State, Society, Humanity, I am a “wicked man”, a “criminal”, a “delinquent”. “Sacred”! This is the most monstrous and terrible phantom before which all have trembled up to now. Here is the old, harsh tablet that the new human beings must shatter!

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In leftist circles, democracy is often used as a synonym for all that is good and egalitarian in the world. It is used as a magic word that will somehow turn everything it touches consensual and non-exploitative, that benefits everyone and ends oppression, something which all of society should be patterned off of. Anarchists, especially those of a communist bent, although they should ostensibly be opposed to the sort of bureaucratic socialism that leftism is usually associated with, often fall into this trap as well, treating “democracy” as a magical solution that, no matter what the form or the application, will automatically make anything better, a &lt;em&gt;morally good&lt;/em&gt; sacred idea which should be shoehorned into every situation. This is how you end up with “anarchists” pushing for community councils delegating jobs and resources by majoritarian democratic vote, and calling anything they like “democratic.” I want to push back on both of these usages, however. I think that not all democracy is equal, and that sometimes it can be a force for harm. This is something I mentioned very briefly in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.alexisdumas.org/2022/01/17/what-is-individualist-anarchism.html&quot;&gt;individualist anarchism&lt;/a&gt; essay, but I think it bears more thorough examination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I think responding to the democratic myths of, especially leftist, but also neoliberal, statists, is worthwhile, because illustrating to them how their favorite sacred ideal isn’t perfect and can fail people in very significant ways is a good way to free up their minds for accepting the anarchist position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/democracy.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Borrowed from Crimetheinc&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many things in the real world, democracy manifests along a spectrum. Democracy may only rarely be found in the purely small, specific, and situational manner that I believe most embodies anarchist egalitarian ideals - “democracy as tool” -, and not all instances of democracy that do not fully uphold those ideals might fall into the same traps and dangers as fully reified large scale democracy. Nevertheless, I think exploring these two extreme ends of the spectrum should give us a good idea of what, exactly, we want to look for in a healthy application of democracy, and what pitfalls, traps, dangers, and harms might become more likely as we move away from that ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;democracy-as-cooperative-tool&quot;&gt;Democracy As Cooperative Tool&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a crucial difference between democracy understood in as a useful tool, and democracy understood as a sacred ideal. The first way uses democracy to help solve the particular conflicts which might arise over how to achieve particular goals shared between multiple people, or how to make decisions concerning certain material objects which multiple people rely on, use, or occupy, such as a house several people live in, or factory machinery. It arises because several people with somewhat conflicting interests all have their autonomy and interests bound up in something common, so that any decision concerning that thing effects the others in a way that would constitute an unconscionable subordination of their interests if done without their input. In such a situation, those involved need a way to resolve their disagreements, and voting on it is often viewed as a fair-enough way to do it, even if imperfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Democracy-as-tool only arises if this possibility for dispute is at least somewhat persistent, instead of a simple one-off which could be decided in any number of other ways (such as drawing straws, or debate); yet, it must be targeted to solve a specific problem and about a particular thing. In other words, it must only make decisions concerning actions that actually effect others. For instance, if we’re talking about factory machinery, if someone were to use the machinery but was careful to repair any damage, perform maintenance, and leave everything as they found it, and not actually prevent anyone who also wanted to use the machinery from using it, that wouldn’t effect anyone else, so it is not a proper subject of possible conflict resolution. Furthermore, democracy-as-tool, to remain as such, must not include any more people than those who are actually party to the conflict, effected by the decisions that are made concerning the specific issue at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these principles are violated, and democracies become large, organized affairs that persist for longer than the problem they were designed to solve actually exists, which dictate rules and regulations for things that don’t actually effect others, the association starts to become reified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, there three properties that typically identify democracy when it is used as a tool are that it is &lt;strong&gt;small&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;specific&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;situational&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following sections, I will discuss why each of these properties are so critical to democracy remaining a useful and benign force for liberation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;democracy-as-tool-small&quot;&gt;Democracy-As-Tool: Small&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why must democracies specifically remain small?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, because as the size of a decision-making group grows, consensus democracy - which is the only way to properly balance the interests of everyone equally, protecting each person’s autonomy and preventing subjugation - becomes less and less practical. Instead of focusing on being inclusive, hearing out as many points of view as possible and trying to integrate everything as much as possible, majoritarian (and representative) democracy will begin to take over, as people give up caring about the minority in favor of practicality and rapidity of decision-making. Now, sure, even consensus decision-making is imperfect - this is why individual, autonomous, stygmergic action is by far the superior option and should be preferred as much as possible - nevertheless, majoritarian democracy is a categorically different beast. Majoritarian democracy inherently completely subjugates the interests of the minority to those of the majority, constituting essentially a form of mob rule that can often be achieved through simple force in cases where community defense and decentralized power aren’t a thing. Majoritarian democracy has the effect of sacrificing a small minority of people in order to serve the interests - including stability and order - of the majority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, because when the size of a democratic decision-making body grows beyond the size absolutely necessary to consider the interests of those directly effected by its decisions, it automatically becomes a form of absentee authority and governance, and begins enacting the fundamental principle of authoritarianism: controlling how other people live their lives and exercise their autonomy purely for the sake of doing so, instead of in self-defense or in compromise with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/art1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;[no title] by Constant&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To clarify what I mean here, let me first make a distinction between two kinds of interests:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;autonomous interests:&lt;/strong&gt; interests that don’t inherently require the subjugation of anyone else; that just concern your own exercise of self-determination and autonomy, which includes your own person and the things you use, occupy, or otherwise depend on for that autonomy. Defending these interests may require other people to change their behaviors to accommodate you - such as not harming you or entering your house or stealing your possessions - but they fundamentally do not require those things, only for you to be left alone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;despotic interests:&lt;/strong&gt; interests that inherently require not just the cooperation, but the involuntary subjugation of others, that you gain by controlling how other people live their lives directly, or through threatening to take away the things they depend on for autonomy and self-determination. This kind always requires violence that is clearly not in self-defense, but instead in defense of the privilege that you gain from exploiting others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The classic paradigmatic case of this distinction is that between the occupant of a house and their landlord. If no one else is using a house, it’s a direct extension of the autonomy and self-determination of the occupant, something they have an interest in because they need a roof over their head and somewhere to live. Meanwhile, all the landlord gets out of owning a house is the ability to extract rent, which they can do because they are enabled by the state to violently evict the actual occupant of the house. While the occupant’s interest in their house are autonomous, because they only require the respect and non-interference of others, and have to do with exercising and maintaining their self-determination as an individual, the landlord’s interests are despotic, as they have no real interest in the house itself, since they do not use it and it is not an extension of their autonomy, they only have an interest in what they can gain by controlling the living conditions of someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to examine this distinction is by putting it in terms of authority or subjugation: while the occupant of the house only needs others to recognize and respect their interests as equally important, and so if they all also have places to live, to respect their desire for privacy in their dwelling place, and any limitation of the autonomy of others required by these interests is only in the assertion of the equality of these interests, to make sure they are represented at all, the landlord’s interests are asserted to the exclusion of the interests of the occupant, who must rely on the landlord’s whims, and indicate special privilege which comes at a &lt;em&gt;cost&lt;/em&gt; to the interests of the occupant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this is about who has control over your life: you - self-determination, autonomy - or someone else - domination and authority -, but trying to strictly delineate every relationship into either one or the other is a fool’s errand. These definitions aren’t a list of necessary and sufficient conditions, an essentialist taxonomy - instead they are accounts of the social and phenomenological aspects that make these two kinds of relationships importantly different to one’s subjective experience of being in such relationships. We assess which of these an actual relationship is more like not by analyzing some essence embedded inside it, but by ascertaining its family resemblance. Furthermore, these are merely two poles on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cathyreisenwitz.substack.com/p/consent-is-non-binary&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;spectrum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of human relations, which can be more or less despotic or autonomous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/cryinginchains.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Crying in Chains by Margaret Blanchfield&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does this relate to democracy? Well, I think that engaging in consensus-based decision-making with all those that are effected by some decision is a clear case of attempting to represent the autonomous interests of all those involved. The purpose is to ensure that the actions of others don’t harm the people who are effected by them, and that everyone’s interests are considered equally and represented fairly in whatever decision is made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as we introduce people that are not directly effected by the outcome of a decision to the decision-making process, however, we begin to run into problems. First of all, knowledge, and incentive problems begin to show up, since these new people won’t have much tacit knowledge of the matter at hand, nor have much of an incentive to learn about it or engage in the decision-making process, and, most importantly, they won’t be subject to the outcomes they cause in any case. More importantly, however, it subjects those who actually have their autonomy and self-determination bound up in something to the wishes of those who otherwise would not be effected by their decisions at all. In other words, it opens up the opportunity for people to extend their despotic interests by controlling things that do not effect them and do not factor into their own personal autonomy and self-determination but do effect others’. Imagine, for instance, that suddenly your neighbors across the street had an equal say in what you did to maintain your house as those who live with you in your house do. What possible interest could they actually have in that, except to control you? What interest could they have in it &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; a despotic one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the relationship of an absentee voter and the rest of the voting body is not precisely the same as that between an absentee landlord and a tenant - to insist that it was would be absurd. In fact, it’s quite less severe, as long as most of the people involved remain local to the problem. But the principle is the same, and as the number of such “absentee voters” grows, so, too, does the despotism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;democracy-as-tool-specific-and-situational&quot;&gt;Democracy-As-Tool: Specific and Situational&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar problems face any democratic decision-making process that begins to metastasize beyond it’s original problem and situation. Once such a decision-making arrangement begins to exist outside the context within which it evolved, it begins to become reified of necessity. No longer is it a specific behavior perpetuated by specific people who are motivated by the existence of a specific problem; in order for it to be possible to uproot it from the problem it was supposed to solve, the question it was the answer to, it must cease to become a solution, an answer, and become instead a thing in its own right, which raises its own questions. It has to become, in essence, self-contained in order for being removed from its environment to become possible at all. Thus, it becomes an “organization” with a life of its own, which maintains itself as different people join and leave, gets its own name and institutionalizes itself. It becomes a thing quite apart from the people that actually compose it, somehow, by the process that all collectivities do this by, a sort of social epiphenomena that creates corporate forms, and begins to seek the perpetuation of itself. Suddenly, people start to serve it, instead of it serving people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/letter-to-my-son.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Letter to my Son by Asger Jorn&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of this process, it will begin to assert itself in all sorts of situations where the people that compose it are not effected, but are merely exercising the power of authority and control over others. After all, now that it is a self-contained, reified entity, it has no original problem to solve - it must go in search of a new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is crucial that the parties to any decision-making process which begins to become such a collectivity make the conscious choice, and accompanying effort, to destroy it before it begins to wreak real havoc. Otherwise it will turn into the exact sort of Socialist Office of Circumlocutions that most Marxist-Leninist organizations, and even some anarchist ones, tend to become - huge bureaucratic dinosaurs bent on self-perpetuation in the name of preserving the collectivity which everyone must sacrifice in the name of. This commitment to destroying collectivities before they become Organizations must be part of the cultural, conscious leveling mechanisms that any anarchist society must employ, just as egalitarian societies before them did, to maintain liberty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;democracy-as-reified-entity&quot;&gt;Democracy as Reified Entity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this discussion, we might begin to see why democracy, when taken in the modern sense as an organizing principle used to unify an entire society, might be problematic. It gives people far away from personal, relational, group, and local matters which are best solved between the interested and effected parties control over them - it gives people control over other people simply for the sake of control, instead of for the sake of having input to prevent others from trampling over one’s autonomy. Thus a group spread out over all of the country decides to enforce certain rules of trade, or marriage, or health, or anything else, on the country as a whole - on people that they will never see, in situations that will never, ever effect them. It allows people to leverage this centralized decision-making power to exercise control over others not to protect their personal interests in their own autonomy, but to further interests that inherently require the subjugation of other people - the furthering of certain projects by taxes, for instance.  Instead of protecting the interests of people where conflicts of interest may arise, this reified form of democracy actually facilitates the destruction of interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/metropolis.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Metropolis George Grosz&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a myriad of fundamental problems with democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, there is the free rider problem: each person’s vote makes very little difference in the overall outcome, especially since if you vote with a minority your vote will mean absolutely nothing, so it isn’t going to be worth it to put much effort into researching the best candidates or laws to vote for. Conversely, in a reified large-scale democracy where - as opposed to a small, temporary, fluid democracy concerned with only one thing - you are making decisions on a myriad of subjects, that will interfere with the highly individual and very diverse lives of millions of people spread out across a large spacial area, so the amount of research you would have to do to be properly informed on every subject is astronomical. It’s much easier to trust the words of dishonest politicians, pundits, and demagogues, especially when you’re busy actually living your life! Thus, the amount of research you should do is extremely high, but your incentive to actually do it is extremely low, leading inevitably to a mass of ignorant and apathetic voters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the cultural pressure to “get out and vote,” telling people that “every vote matters” won’t solve this fundamental problem: even if voting itself is easy enough to do to assuage social pressure, properly researching every policy topic and deciding which candidate to choose based on informed decisions is simply too great a time investment, and not something the people around you can really verify so social pressure doesn’t really apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, there’s an incentive problem: most of the policies politicians suggest won’t even directly effect most voters, so they have little reason to overcome the rational ignorance and apathy that majoritarian democracy leads them to when it is only other people that will bear the cost. Conservative male voters will never be effected by abortion laws or transgender health care bans, so they vote based on “traditional values” and lower taxes, for example. And rationally so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, a fundamental problem with any kind of large scale, reified democracy is that it fundamentally limits our choices. There are a fixed number of bills to vote on, a fixed number of candidates on our sheets, selected by some obscure bureaucrat following some arbitrary rule. Our horizons are fundamentally limited by the imagination and interests of the powerful and those that serve them, the bounds of what’s possible restricted to whatever options they deem safe, sensible, and likely to be voted on. In direct democracies, the laws that we vote on are not written by us, or in service of us, but suggestions that politicians came up with to offer to us. How could it be otherwise? Even if most people had the time to write properly written and researched draft laws, how could a democratic system ever hope to sift through all of them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;representative-democracy&quot;&gt;Representative Democracy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representative democracy cannot save us either. If we don’t have the time or incentive to research the controversies and problems that need to be solved and draft policies ourselves, what reason is there to think we’ll have the time and incentive to monitor the policies and actions of those we elect as “representatives” in enough detail to actually hold them substantially accountable? How would we even begin to really get all that information? Even if we could, the only thing we could do is not elect them again; they’ll still have had their stint in power. Thus, once elected, they are largely free to do whatever they please behind closed doors because no one will actually read the legislation they pass or truly hold them accountable for keeping their promises. As long as they appear to parrot the right talking points to their base, they are free to maintain the status quo and gather power for themselves and their station because few will spend the time to look more deeply into the subjects and policies they propose. People, quite &lt;em&gt;rationally&lt;/em&gt;, go along with whatever the demagogue who most echos what they want to hear says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only that, but you need a lot of money and, most especially, &lt;em&gt;free time&lt;/em&gt; to run for office. Working people, marginalized people, even the middle class, don’t have that kind of time. Thus, the pool of who, practically, can actually run for office is limited to a very specific class of people - who will have different interests from the people who elected them. Moreover, those who have the most time to spend on campaigning and the most money to spend on ads will typically be the ones to win - thus, as competition takes hold and does what it is wont to do, heightening specializations, we end up with a whole class of rich career politicians that represent nearly our only choices. Even when we have an option that isn’t a career politician, it’s someone who has been close with that class for a long time, who tends to be rich and share those interests. Thus representative democracy necessarily leads to an elective aristocracy, usually in service to the oligarchy of rich, famous, and powerful people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/pyramid.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With such a limited pool of choices, all from the same inbred, interrelated, colluding class, do we really have the option to choose someone who will truly act in our interests? Or do we have an oligopoly to choose from, just like we have in the economy - a few huge options that are all fundamentally similar and essentially automatically cartelize just by the nature of their socioeconomic position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;democracy-and-marginalization&quot;&gt;Democracy and Marginalization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By its very nature, reified democracy puts all of the power in society in the hands of the majority or plurality in that society; ultimately, whether you have direct democracy or representative, first past the post voting or ranked choice, proportional representation or winner takes all, it is those who make up the largest section of society that will have ultimate authority. This puts marginalized people forever on a knife’s edge: we are forced to appeal to the sympathy and higher moral feelings of the majority and hope that in their lord-like authority over our lives, which has the power to crush and erase us just as much as the power to lend aid, they choose to do the latter. This places the marginalized and oppressed perpetually on our knees, begging those who benefit from our oppression, who have little interest in our liberation, for permission to live. Even when we win, it is not solid or permanent, and neither does it represent true liberation, because it was not an expression of our equality, autonomy, and power: it was alms granted by an authority over us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/begging.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that we cannot rely on reified democracy to protect the interests of the marginalized in society, because it all depends on the whims of others. Defenders of the sacred “democratic ideal” will argue that if only democracy were more perfect - more representative of the majority, more responsive to the “will of the people” - it would be better, we could trust the majority to take care of us, but the reinforcement of marginalization is an inherent problem with democracy. It can only be exacerbated by making the majority even more powerful. Marginalized people are marginalized as a product of our different experiences and interests: the axes of oppression are constituted by the different experiences and needs that we have from the many. If everyone votes in their interests, marginalized people must remain marginalized, and why should we expect them to do otherwise? The majority cannot deeply care about our needs - for them, ignorance and apathy is rational, because the issues that threaten to crush us are abstract discussions to them, things that happen far away, mostly to people they don’t even know. Often, they don’t even know why we need what we need, why it matters to us, or even &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; we need, and they fundamentally will never understand, because we have fundamentally different experiences. At best, for them, voting to help us is an exercise of charity, something they do to feel better about themselves - but how strong of a motivator is that, really? Can we truly rely on the majority of people to feel that way? The people that make up “the majority”, like everyone else, are necessarily caught up in their own needs and struggles. How can we rely on them to overcome their rational ignorance concerning what we need, and the free rider problem concerning voting, just to help us, when they can barely do so for matters that directly effect them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guardians of the sacred democratic ideal will argue that if only the marginalized were able to clearly make their case before “the people,” the majority would be swayed by their case and choose to vote to help them, but if any view is utopian, it is this one. Voting is not a matter of objective rationality. Morality is not an objective thing that you can demonstrate logically or scientifically: each person’s morality is shaped by their culture, lives, experiences, and interests. Tolerance of queer people is just something that benefits us, and that some allies have come to like either because they know queer people or because they like it aesthetically. There is no rational argument that will convince a bigot to stop being a bigot, that will establish tolerance as the ultimate principle of morality, or that will convince people to care about issues that don’t really effect them. The best we can do is appeal to their empathy, as opposed to their own interests and rational apathy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if morality were something that could be used to objectively prove that everyone should care about the plight of the marginalized, since when did we expect pure dialectical rationality to win out among the majority? Again, it is utopian to think that people will be more interested in abstract argument, in rationality, in philosophy, in being “morally right,” than their own interests and the rhetoric and tribalism of demagogues. Rational arguments don’t have any inherent metaphysical power that ensures that they must “win” with the majority of people. Everyone votes for their own interests or in favor of their own sacred ideals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor is the solution - as the neo-reactionaries would have it - to return to aristocracy or oligarchy or monarchy: these merely create an entirely new problem, granting absolute power to those who are already powerful in society and perpetuating it. The reason democracy seems better than aristocracy or monarchy is directly tied up with its fatal oppressive flaw - it makes &lt;em&gt;most people in society&lt;/em&gt; happy. But just because it makes society more stable by serving the interests of most people, so that there is no longer any revolutionary fervor, so that &lt;em&gt;fewer&lt;/em&gt; people are ground beneath the heel of the state, does not mean we must accept it. Why should we accept our sacrifice on the alter of the sacred democratic ideal just so that “the majority” can rest comfortably? Why must we remain permanent second class citizens, serfs of the lordship of Numbers? There are other ways than simply rule by many or rule by few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;democracy-society-and-progress&quot;&gt;Democracy, Society, and Progress&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we have seen, therefore, when democracy is taken as a sacred idea, and democratic decision-making processes are allowed to be reified into their own entities to which people must sacrifice, it becomes particularly harmful. The ultimate example of this, large scale national majoritarian democracy, is particularly damaging, especially to the marginalized - a form of redistributing the benefits of society, sacrificing the few on the altar of the many. To prevent this, we must strive to view democratic decision-making as one tool among many, not a moral ideal, and one that must be kept as small, specific, and situational as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recognize that sometimes the perfect ideal of democracy that I put forward in the first half of this essay - based around &lt;a href=&quot;https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/castanea-dentata-the-union-of-egoists&quot;&gt;Stirner’s union of egoists&lt;/a&gt; - may never be perfectly achieved. But it can form the basis of a conscious, intentional practice of practical anarchism in social situations: intentional leveling mechanisms, intentional choices to move closer to it. Just as we see such social and structural mechanisms ingrained in every fiber of every long-lasting egalitarian society we find, anarchists must also ingrain a commitment to egalitarianism and individual autonomy into their theory and practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an example of how this might pan out, let’s look at situations where the ideal of democracy must often be compromised. In situations where a democratically organized decision-making group must be maintained over extended periods of time and over fairly large scales - for instance, in industrial production - it must remain always predicated on the actual need for that group to exist. Furthermore, where consensus cannot be reached but a decision still needs to be made, which is more likely to happen as the size of a decision-making body grows larger, majoritarian democracy can sometimes be used as a fall-back secondary line of defense - but, crucially, that decision making procedure must &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; be agreed to by all beforehand, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.alexisdumas.org/2022/05/13/fuck-the-state.html#4-coldly-it-lieth-also&quot;&gt;not forced on them as in the case of a national democracy&lt;/a&gt;, and disassociation must remain a viable, accepted, and supported option for those that believe they are being taken advantage of by the majority’s decision. In such cases of large-scale democratic decision-making, decentralization and compartmentalization are good options as well: disassociation will naturally lead to people separating into groups based on affinity, common purpose and goals, etc; these groups can then federate together in a bottom-up non-hierarchical manner as a means of organizing on a larger scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More generally, what is the alternative to democratic government of society which does not screw marginalized people over? The only way to ensure that one’s interests are protected is to destroy the power and authority of those who could suppress them and oppress you - destroy the state, be it democratic or not, which is the fulcrum by which the power of our oppressors is wielded. Instead of kneeling, appealing to those who have placed themselves in authority over us, instead of taking the position of serfs appealing to a lord, we must entirely reject the principle of authority and seize the power to defend ourselves from oppression. The only guarantee is decentralization, distribution of power, so that each person holds in their hands the power to fight for their own autonomy. We cannot rest on our laurels, we cannot wait for the arc of history to bend our way, we cannot bow before the will of the people. Instead we must be ready to defend ourselves and our communities: not to wage an offensive war - a coup or revolution - but to protect ourselves. We must develop our capacities for community self-defense and dual power, defending ourselves and our own and supporting each other as well. We cannot rely on anyone else to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this alternative anarchist world that I &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.alexisdumas.org/2022/05/11/vision-anarchist.html&quot;&gt;envision&lt;/a&gt;, composed of small, specific, situational democracies and fluid non-hierarchical associations built around serving various community needs as the people actually need them, and local conflict resolution between the actual people involved in any conflict, all defended by &lt;a href=&quot;https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/scott-crow-liberatory-community-armed-self-defense&quot;&gt;community mutual self-defense associations&lt;/a&gt; composed of part-time members of the community and accountable to everyone, there is little room for the sort of unifying entity (the democratic state) that makes “society” what it is today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That does not make it impossible to have a society, however; it just means that we will have stop conflating society with the state. A real society is composed of a distributed network of people who interact with each other at least semi-regularly, who trade things and communicate and travel back and forth. It is not connected from the top down, like a tree graph, by one node up top that everyone is connected to - it is woven together like a rug, the actual ties between people connecting the whole social fabric from end to end in a chain of transitive attachment. Consider something like the internet: a huge network of decentralized local groups, all connected to the wider community not by a central authority or singular institution, but by the web of voluntary connections that they themselves make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sort of picture of a society as a meta-organism arising from the mutual attachments of smaller entities - communities, which are then in turn composed by friend groups and personal networks, which are then in turn composed of people - might frighten those who are too used to the modern situation in America or other developed nations. Instantly, images will be conjured up of small, rural, isolated Midwestern American townships composed largely of ignorant bigots. Without the liberal majority in the country overall - concentrated in a few cities - to control them, what might happen? This picture, however, is merely a product of an accident of history and geography. We could just as easily have a society where the majority is bigoted, and there are only a few safe enclaves of queer people, people of color, etc. Thus this effect of majoritarian democracy working to (somewhat) restrict the advances of bigotry and intolerance is hardly a necessary property of it, and, moreover, given the reasoning above, much of that usefulness is quite restricted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In comparison, without the state, I believe minorities will be vastly better off. Most importantly, there will be no existing centralized seat of power for bigots to seize control of and wield against minority communities. In an anarchist society, power is distributed and decentralized, primarily in the hands of each individual to bargain and compromise and engage in reciprocal, mutually beneficial relations with their neighbors according to what benefits all of them; derivatively held by the diffuse social sanctions of different members of society and loose part-time associations, as well as communities that band together for mutual aid. Therefore, bigots would have to get off their couches and organize themselves, put their lives and limbs on the line, and, crucially, minority communities would in turn have much more equal power to resist. No more Reagan disarming black people trying to hold racist cops accountable. No more police being lenient on or even helping white supremacists while cracking down on leftists. Community defense is quite effective, too - there is a long-standing history of asymmetrical urban resistance and protest to draw upon here, and all that needs to be done is to make it sufficiently dangerous and risky to try to enforce the will of the bigoted majority on minority communities that it simply isn’t worth it for them anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it should be noted that whatever sociocultural factors a defender of the democratic sacred ideal might appeal to to explain why democracy would be a positive force for justice and egalitarianism - good education, a tolerant culture, even the rationality of the mob and its susceptibility to “moral argument,” laughable as that is - could just as easily, and perhaps even more justly, be claimed by an anarchist society. Thus whatever positive benefits democracy can claim, anarchism can claim them two-fold insofar as the majority has power over the minority in an anarchist society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;epilogue&quot;&gt;Epilogue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I put my lips to your profane ear and launch a cry. A frightening cry that will make you grow pale… So listen to it, since only by virtue of this magic cry will you vanish as rabble in order to rise up again in the flowering potential of all of your individualized members. Here is the magic cry: “The egoist has always affirmed himself with crime and, with sacrilegious hand, has pulled the sacred idols down from their pedestals. It is necessary to put an end to the sacred; or better still: the need to violate the sacred must become general. It is not a new revolution that approaches; but a mighty, impetuous, superb, shameless, conscienceless crime sounds in the thunder on the horizon. Don’t you see how already the foreboding sky grows dark and silent?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[L]isten again…: “Put your hand on whatever you need. Take it; it is yours. This is the declaration of the war of all against all. I alone am the judge of what I want to have.” Now do you understand, oh rabble, what the crime that SOUNDS IN THE THUNDER ON THE HORIZON is? But you, oh rabble, may not yet know how to adapt yourself to the idea of eternal war, you who have cradled yourself like a poor baby in the sweet dreams of eternal peace. And who even knows how many idols you still have to worship and on whose altars you still have to sacrifice yourself!

  &lt;p&gt;You want, if possible – and there is no more insane “if possible” – to abolish suffering. And we? It really seems that we would rather have it higher and worse than ever. Well-being as you understand it – that is no goal, that seems to us an end, a state that soon makes man ridiculous and contemptible – that makes his destruction desirable. The discipline of suffering, of great suffering – do you not know that only this discipline has created all enhancements of man so far? — Nietzsche, &lt;em&gt;Beyond Good and Evil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A kaleidoscopic whirlwind of pernicious lies, half-truths, misrepresentations, abuse, and bigotry swirl around trans people. I’m privileged to live in California and on the PSU University Park campus primarily, where I’m insulated from the worst of American transphobia in my everyday physical life, but on the internet, where we are all connected regardless of location, and where anonymity protects those who wish to do us harm just as much as it helps us hide from it, it’s not so easy. Every once in awhile something slips through, usually due to my own actions. One such instance occurred yesterday, when I found myself engaging in a digital self-harming spree, scrolling through the abusive, ignorant, and hateful comments under a Medium article by trans feminist Julia Serano. Through the flurry of vitriol, one comment stood out to me as particularly harmful and insidious. It posed a simple question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why not fix them?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not “fix” transgender people. If we believe we were born the wrong sex, and biological sex can never be fully changed, then we are forever doomed to be somewhat dissatisfied with our bodies no matter what changes we make. Instead of trying to change the body to match the mind, the commenter asked, why not change the mind to match the body? Why not give transgender people some kind of treatment to make us happy with the body we were born with, instead of trying, imperfectly, to make us more comfortable in our own bodies?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the central idea behind transgender conversion therapy. We already know that conversion therapy is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2749479&quot;&gt;harmful&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8189432/&quot;&gt;traumatizing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/08/i-still-have-flashbacks-the-global-epidemic-of-lgbt-conversion-therapy&quot;&gt;disgusting&lt;/a&gt; practice that makes normative assumptions that are unacceptable to anyone in modern society, and is in general &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hrc.org/resources/policy-and-position-statements-on-conversion-therapy&quot;&gt;incompatible with human rights&lt;/a&gt;. We already know that there is no evidence that such practices are effective, and that what evidence there is indicates that they are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/conversion-therapy-an-evidence-assessment-and-qualitative-study&quot;&gt;ineffective&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=&quot;https://genderanalysis.net/2016/12/myth-pimozide-and-gender-dysphoria-gender-analysis/&quot;&gt;based on misunderstood science&lt;/a&gt;, and that gender transition is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-well-being-of-transgender-people/&quot;&gt;best treatment we know of&lt;/a&gt;, and is substantially, significantly effective. I’m not here to litigate that. If you disagree, you can go fuck yourself. I’m here to explain why &lt;em&gt;even if conversion therapy worked&lt;/em&gt;, the entire concept is horrifying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-gender&quot;&gt;What is Gender?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand why this suggestion to “fix” transgender people is so gut-wrenchingly horrifying, to understand it on an intimate level, you really need to think about gender for a second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important thing you have to understand is that gender is more than sex. It’s more than what sex you have, and it’s more than what sex you want. Sex is a component of it - part of what makes many trans people dissatisfied with their birth sex characteristics is how they conflict with their gender, and most cis people are happy with their sex characteristics because they allow them to better embody their gender - but gender is not fully encompassed by sex. 
Do not misunderstand me: transitioning physically is vitally important to most trans people, and any attempt to deny that is harmful and disingenuous. Nevertheless, I don’t think many of us would call it the only thing that mattered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To claim that gender is equivalent to sex forces you to face two horns of a dilemma: you either have to reduce the meaning of gender to nothingness, since none of the social realities of gender that we actually care about - presentation, identification, social roles and relationships, behavior - actually necessarily arise from such biological sex traits, or you have to engage in the new-age mysticism of biological determinism, which treats chromosomes or some other biological reality as this ineffable, immaterial spirit which somehow permeates someone with “maleness” or “femaleness” in some meaningful way and influences actions according to evolutionary just-so stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking the first horn of this dilemma is nonsensical, since it completely obliterates gender as a socially meaningful concept, and leaves us with nothing to replace it, since sex cannot step in to fill the gap, as we will see when we look at the second horn of the dilemma. We are left with the question of how to understand the gendered social realities and subjectivities we exist in and which exist around us without the words and concepts to describe them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man does not cease being a man if he’s lost his dick, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://medbox.iiab.me/kiwix/wikipedia_en_medicine_2019-12/A/Penile_agenesis_and_testicular_agenesis&quot;&gt;was born with a congenital deformity that robbed him of one&lt;/a&gt;. A woman does not cease to be a woman when she gets a hysterectomy or mastectomy, or even if she was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pennmedicine.org/for-patients-and-visitors/patient-information/conditions-treated-a-to-z/mayer-rokitansky-kuster-hauser-mrkh-syndrome&quot;&gt;born without a uterus&lt;/a&gt;. When we meet someone, we don’t check in their pants or ask for a 23andMe karyotype test, we look at how they present, how they act, and how they ask to be referred to. Neither do we ask to see their birth certificate, which merely looks at genitals at birth and makes a guess - that would be to make the same mistake of defining gender by genitals, with the added fallacy of assuming that legality makes truth, and that people cannot change. When there are intersex conditions that mix and match sex characteristics such that you can have &lt;a href=&quot;https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/androgen-insensitivity-syndrome/&quot;&gt;a woman with XY chromosomes&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11268892/&quot;&gt;a man with XX chromosomes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001669.htm&quot;&gt;or something else entirely&lt;/a&gt;, we still identify them as their chosen or apparent gender, and clearly, obviously so. Indeed, most of the time, no one knows that they have these intersex conditions, including them! If sex is all there is, what does this actually mean? There is a meaningfulness to gender, it is a social reality, however much it is constructed, and without the concept of gender we can’t explain that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking the second horn of the dilemma is likewise a bad choice. It is extremely harmful, and feminists have fought for decades against this very bioessentialist mysticism precisely because it has limiting and harmfully normative implications both for the women who are oppressed by it, and the men who are both limited and also given a free pass by it. To define a woman in terms of (the mythic idea of the implications of) her vagina or uterus is dehumanizing, and to define a man in terms of (the mythic idea of the implications of) his penis or his testosterone similarly perpetuates harmful ideas. Moreover, it is simply wrong: what do chromosomes really mean? No one can see them, most people haven’t even had a karyotype test and so don’t even know their chromosomes. Moreover, does having XY chromosomes actually mean anything independently of one’s other sex characteristics, one’s personality, and how one internalized social norms of gender (through identification with a certain gender and internalization of the associated norms)? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/strange-but-true-testosterone-alone-doesnt-cause-violence/&quot;&gt;Recent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/12/091208132241.htm&quot;&gt;science&lt;/a&gt; shows, for instance, that there is no clear link between testosterone and aggression, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisonescalante/2021/11/12/men-are-just-as-emotional-as-women-says-new-research/?sh=6d32b5d72e96&quot;&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; shows that women are not more emotional than men, to name just two bioessentialist fallacies. Thus, gender disappears under the myopic eye of biological &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_essentialism&quot;&gt;essentialism&lt;/a&gt; while sexism is almost fundamentally furthered by it. Defining someone in terms of the mere biological characteristics they have is reductionist, dehumanizing, and has negative normative implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is gender, then? Your gender is characterized by a broad set of complex, interconnected, socially constructed, non-binary traits: how you want to be embodied in the world, who you identify with, how you want to relate to others and how you want others to relate to you, what likes and dislikes you have, how you want to express yourself, and a dizzying array of other qualities. It is an interior, subjective understanding of oneself, and one’s own ideal self-image, which forms and shapes who you are at a fundamental level, even if it is not the most important thing to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gender is not socially indoctrinated into you, either - we are not born “blank slates” which society inscribes gender onto; it is a part of who we are just in the way other important parts of our identity and personality are. We can see this in how &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1201664/&quot;&gt;children ages 2-3 years old begin to develop an idea of what gender they are, and pay more attention to same-gender role models in order to learn how best to express that gender&lt;/a&gt;. Gender is thus recognized beyond the borders of strict stereotypes, but we understand how we want to express our gender from the role models around us. We can also see this exemplified in the John Money experiment, where no matter how hard Money tried to change the gender identity of David Reimer, it &lt;a href=&quot;https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/david-reimer-and-john-money-gender-reassignment-controversy-johnjoan-case&quot;&gt;didn’t work&lt;/a&gt;. There are also &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18761592/&quot;&gt;neurological&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18056697/&quot;&gt;underpinnings&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18980961/&quot;&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-018-0140-7&quot;&gt;gender&lt;/a&gt; as well - the brain itself has gendered averages, although not on a large enough scale to considerably effect cognitive function, nor in a way that can be essentialized and strictly separated.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on this, what you identify your gender as - what name you give it, what category you assign it to - depends on your own conceptual categories for what gender is. These are different from person to person, since one’s upbringing and cultural background modify what you perceive gender to be. In one time period or place, someone with the exact same gender might identify, or be identified, with a completely different gender category entirely. Thus, I call myself a woman because who I want to be, my internal sense of gender as described above, aligns with the cultural concept we assign to the arbitrary group of sounds “woman.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since gender categories differ from person to person as well as culture to culture - although they tend to overlap - everyone has a different understanding of what constitutes womanhood or manhood or any other gender; yet, crucially, we can still recognize the gender that someone is embodying for the most part. This is because we actually use family resemblance &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_resemblance&quot;&gt;family resemblance&lt;/a&gt;, not our own categories, or conceptual essences, to recognize someone’s gender: there is no single set of necessary and sufficient conditions that will identify who is a woman and who is not, for example. Any suggestion that there is one must either run afoul of exceptions, or enforce itself violently on the women (even cis ones) it wants to “describe,” as we have seen throughout history. It is harmful and demeaning, not to mention usually sexist, to deny someone their gender just because they don’t live up to &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; conception of gender - to call a man a girl because he has long hair, or tell a woman she’s not a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; woman because she works in the office instead of taking care of the kids at home. There is no essence to any gender. Instead, gender is defined by the overlap between the various conceptions and lived embodiments of that gender in the world, none sharing precisely the same characteristics in precisely the same way, but all close enough to resemble each other in a transitive chain of similarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of this overlap is ‘gender identity.’ In other words, part of what makes a woman, for example, identifiable, whether she wears a dress or jeans, whether she is a stay at home mother or a software developer, whether she is a femme or a butch, is the identification with other people of the social category of womanhood, the recognition of likeness and kinship, the desire to be recognized as one of them. Even if they express and understand their gender differently, this fundamental identification with other recognizable members of one’s gender constitutes one’s gender identity, and it is one of the most important aspects of what determines one’s gender. Many things that make cis and trans people happy in expressing their gender flow from the fact that they saw &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; women express their gender that way and felt a kinship based on gender identity with them, and internalized them as role models. Skirts aren’t inherently gendered, but they grow to be associated with a gender in our minds, and so most trans and cis women get the gender-related feeling of prettiness and ‘performing womanhood’ that they get out of wearing them precisely from that association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you doubt that cis people desire to be their gender, just ask them! If you do, you’ll find that most of them (&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-014-0452-6&quot;&gt;about 98%, according to one study of a few thousand people in Belgium&lt;/a&gt;) actively identify with the gender they were assigned at birth. This is intuitively true from experience as well. It is a rare cis person who merely feels ambivalent about their gender, who just “happens” to be a man or a woman but who could really care less; most cis people are very happy to be men or women, enjoy being themselves &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; alignment with their own gender, and wouldn’t know how to live except as their own gender. Men want to embody an idea of masculinity - even if they refuse the culturally constructed one as toxic - and women do likewise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even voluntarily gender non-conforming cis people don’t like being assumed to be the other gender, or trans in general, and they enjoy breaking gender norms precisely &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; their AGAB. Conversely, cis people are unhappy when forced to be gender-nonconforming, such as women with PCOS, men with gynocomastia, and men with prostate or testicular cancer who have to deal with keeping their testosterone up, for example. It’s not easy to just simply “change” this either, and attempts to do this, &lt;a href=&quot;https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/david-reimer-and-john-money-gender-reassignment-controversy-johnjoan-case&quot;&gt;even on cis people&lt;/a&gt; have been shown to fail. Cis people often get gender-affirming plastic surgery or generally want to change their appearance to better conform to their gendered ideas of aesthetics all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women who are unhappy with the patriarchal structure of the world and the misogyny they experience don’t want to stop being women - being forced to stop being a woman in order to escape misogyny would be a &lt;strong&gt;defeat&lt;/strong&gt;! Instead, they want to remain women, but have more freedom, autonomy, and respect. Feminist women fight for women precisely because they identify as women and want to remain women without the enforced negative social effects of that in our sexist society. Simply “escaping womanhood” would not be acceptable to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this means that gender is a fundamental expression of someone’s identity. It defines their ideal self-image, and it colors most interactions you will have with other people, many of your likes and dislikes, how you feel about yourself, and much more. It’s both a filter that we see things through which permeates our lives, and crucial to our understandings of ourselves and how we live. Gender is a component of &lt;em&gt;who we are&lt;/em&gt;, just like our personality or other components of identity, such as identifying with cultures or families. Gender is not something merely imposed from the outside for most people, it is something actively identified with and perpetuated, and that is the fundamental motivational force and constitutive element of gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-transgender-conversion-therapy-is-horrifying&quot;&gt;Why Transgender Conversion Therapy is Horrifying&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on this, you can start to see how horrifying the idea of changing someone’s gender is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an outgrowth of the paternalistic, behaviorist, shallow-minded mindset common among doctors, where the ‘expert’ is content to treat everything as a shallow physical or neurological problem that can be solved with simple chemical treatment of the symptoms alone, without looking more deeply into the psychological, social, environmental, and economic causes that might cause these problems, and without any interest in respecting the individuality of the person or their struggle as an individual against the existing social and material reality which was not shaped for them. If something is causing you pain, stop wanting anything different, they say. It is an attitude which is existentially terrifying for the marginalized because it seeks to conform someone to a world that hates their existence, was not made to include them, which denies them, irrespective of who they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It suggests that, just because some (gendered) desire can’t be perfectly satisfied, we simply &lt;em&gt;erase that part of the person completely&lt;/em&gt;. We make you, and what you want, fit “reality” as it is, instead of allowing you to be who you are and be dissatisfied with reality and maybe work to change it. This is the logic of emptiness and destruction of identity. No desire can be perfectly satisfied; part of life is continually pursuing new desires and old: that’s what gives you the motive power to continue living at all. Logic that views desire as the source of dissatisfaction and pain, and therefore as something to eliminate, is death itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is essentially partial lobotomization: destroying who someone is to make them “normal,” to ensure “conformity,” and to make them “happy.” Perhaps they might be happy after such a procedure, but is it really &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;? How much of the person they were before is truly left? Is this the happiness of a person who’s mind has been changed, or the happiness of a partial vegetable? Do I walk into your doctor’s office, and never walk out, traipsing to my psychological maiming at the hands of your psychiatric gaslighting, electroshock therapy, neurosurgical butchering? If a woman in the 1800s is unhappy with her gender role, and wants to go out and work or study on her own, wear pants, and be independent from her husband, what do we do - do we tell her that such things are impossible, so we must conform the mind to material reality, and convince her through psychiatric abuse and gaslighting to stop wanting those things, to make her happy with the situation as it currently stands, do we lobotomize her, as was often done? Are you recoiling in horror at this? You should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the logic of &lt;em&gt;Brave New World&lt;/em&gt; - your desires don’t fit reality, you won’t be perfectly happy, so let us pump you full of chemicals and make you happy again. Forget what you wanted, forget all the parts of who you are that make you struggle for existence against the world around you. Conform. &lt;em&gt;Sleep.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’d rather be myself and fucking miserable&lt;/strong&gt;. I’d rather be a woman trapped in a body like that of a hairy ape than be a man. Fuck you and fuck your fixing. Don’t fix me. I’m not broken just because I’ll never be &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; satisfied with my body (is anyone?). I can make it better, so much better, I can be happy as I am, I’ll have my ups and downs but so do we all, that’s part of what it means to live, I want to fucking live! Get your suffocating hands off me. I don’t want your happiness - I want will to power! I want to struggle against reality and win an ongoing battle with it. I want to become who I am against the odds, not give up what I want because it’s too hard. Some of us have to struggle with some measure of inherent dissatisfaction all our lives - does that make us lesser? Would you erase the manhood of a man who lost his penis in war? Would you tell someone paralyzed from the waist down that they shouldn’t wish they could walk again?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fully demolish the pernicious thought patterns that could lead someone to say something like this, I would have to demolish the entire idea that there is some innate human nature which people have to live up to, that there is a specific way that we must live and things we “should” want. I would have to pull up the entire edifice of Western philosophy by the roots and reveal it to be the hubristic farce that it is. That is not the subject for a short essay, so instead I hope that this impassioned plea, with its clarifications and analogies, might hopefully act as an intuition pump, something to bring at least a little understanding to people so that they go back and question their own assumptions. In the final analysis, though, this essay boils down to one thing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t fix us. We don’t want your fixing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is because there is significant overlap in the distributions of “female brains” and “male brains.” The studies I showed only show that trans people’s brains are closer to the “male” or “female” average. This uncertainty is why the medicalization of transgender people is dangerous; relying on “brain scans” to determine if someone is “mentally female” or “mentally male” fundamentally misunderstands how science and statistics works. There is not a strictly female or strictly male set of traits in the brain - to think so would be more essentialism - instead there are just &lt;em&gt;slightly different averages&lt;/em&gt;, and some brains are closer to one of the averages than the other. A brain that is technically closer to the “male average” (or vice versa) may still validly contain a female gender identity because there is substantial enough overlap between the two distributions to leave a significant probability of that being the case. After all, the higher-probability outcome does not always happen, that’s the point of probability. That’s how the averages got there, in fact: some cis women’s brains tested closer to the male average, and that’s how there got to be a distribution of “female brains.” Thus, in the end, despite brain scans indicating to some degree the validity of gender identity and transgender people in particular, identity is far too complex to glean directly from a brain scan, just like most identities and complex thoughts are, and the best route is just to ask the person in question what their gender identity is. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A state? What is that? Well! … &lt;strong&gt;A state, is called the coldest of all cold monsters.&lt;/strong&gt; Coldly lieth it also; and this lie creepeth from its mouth: “I, the state, am the people.” … Where there is still a people, there the state is not understood, but hated as the evil eye, and as sin against laws and customs. … The state lieth in all languages of good and evil; and whatever it saith it lieth; and &lt;strong&gt;whatever it hath it hath stolen&lt;/strong&gt;. False is everything in it; with stolen teeth it biteth… — &lt;em&gt;Thus Sake Zarathustra&lt;/em&gt;, Friedrich Nietzsche&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Murder, kidnapping, robbery, bigotry, oppression, poverty, destitution, slavery, exploitation, surveillance, restriction - politicians proclaim on TV, pundits write in the newspaper, and on the lips of every indoctrinated member of the masses, every Last Man, the same logic is blurted out: “the state! the state will protect us from these things!” - yet it is the state itself which is the worst perpetrator of all of them, the most efficient murderer, kidnapper, robber, bigot, oppressor…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state is the institution that holds the monopoly on the ‘legitimate’ use of violence in society: it is the sole authority in society which is granted the power to decide who should and who should not use force, for what purposes, and what the punishments are should those dictates be violated. The state then uses this monopoly on violence to invade the lives of those that fall within its territorial claims - to control what they can and cannot do via laws, and steal their labor product away by taxes. Thus, the two properties of a state: violence, and domination. Already, the problem with the state must be clear to anyone who is interested in individual self-determination and autonomy, and a society founded fundamentally on consent. The state reaches its tendrils out through its servants - cops, soldiers, and bureaucrats - to compel and limit everyone. As Proudhon said, to be governed is to be “watched, inspected, spied upon, directed, law-driven, numbered, regulated, enrolled, indoctrinated, preached at, controlled, checked, estimated, valued, censured, commanded, by creatures who have neither the right nor the wisdom nor the virtue to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-lieth-in-all-languages-of-good-and-evil&quot;&gt;2. Lieth In All Languages of Good and Evil&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first problem with the state as an organization is that it represents an inherent danger to autonomy (even beyond the limits it purports to respect). By centralizing power so extremely, almost nothing remains to counterbalance the power of the state. No one can stand against it, and all are cowed by it. Our only shield against its domination of our lives is its self-imposed limits, but since these limits are only ‘enforced’ by components of the state, they only hold sway insofar as members of the state care to obey them - in other words, it is a promise with no teeth, because there is no consequence for violating it. It’s like a crocodile promising not to snap its jaws shut when you put your head in its mouth. All that prevents the state from seizing as much power as it wants is the general wish of some portion of the population, and tradition. But the wishes of the population are fickle, and changeable, and as we shall see, tend towards increasing state power, not restricting it; and tradition, while powerful, is malleable and manipulable, and ultimately can be discarded even while the appearance of it remains. This ensures that the autonomy of all the individuals within the state’s purview depends wholly on the whims of the people around them and the pleasures of politicians and bureaucrats - not safe hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of this is that the state’s laws already reach into nearly every part of life, from what we can and cannot do with our bodies, to what we can or cannot do in our homes, to what arrangements we can make with others, and what we can produce or sell. Immune from resistance or retaliation, the state, nominally on behalf of the majority, but usually on behalf of the rich elites, strips away so much of our autonomy it is nearly unthinkable, disallowing us from making choices for ourselves about how we wish to live. This is its second sin: the egregious violation of our autonomy far beyond what is necessary to reconcile the conflicts between the autonomy of individuals - and indeed the robbery of conflicting individuals from the autonomy to decide how to resolve their own conflicts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider that in a decentralized anarchist society the only time force would be used would be in self-defense, or in the resolution of some conflict where the personal interests and autonomy of certain individuals came into conflict, because one person’s power could be countered by another, so in matters that truly do not concern one, the possibility of encountering resisting force would not be worth it, whereas in matters where one’s own interests are in conflict with another the possibility of equal forces coming into conflict must ensure equal consideration and a mutually agreeable resolution; moreover, norms focused on protecting autonomy and personal choices would be favored because they are mutually beneficial, and so benefit all to preserve, whereas invasive norms benefit one person at the cost of another, and are not beneficial to all. Thus, the maximum autonomy would be preserved, as violence and invasion would not be used beyond the places where one person’s autonomy was already threatening to subordinate another’s, and here, maximum autonomy would be preserved by the equal consideration of both interests, and allowing both parties to decide for themselves what the resolution might be. Compare this with a statist society, wherein there are no countervailing forces. Whoever possesses the Ring of Power - the state - can do whatever they please, even if it involves deciding which hole someone can put their dick in another! There is no reason beyond the self-promises of the state, and the general mood of the citizenry, to restrict where and what one decides concerning others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This naturally and inevitably creates the domination of some by others, but this domination rarely happens unidirectionally, across clean and comprehensible divisions. Instead, a whole web of interconnecting partial dominations and oppressions by everyone against everyone else ensues, as different people at different times claim control of the omnipotent edifice of the state and turn its baleful glare on their enemies or those they wish to exploit. The very existence of the state, as an immensely powerful, nigh-irresistible weapon, turns society into an immense circular firing squad, with everyone exploiting everyone else to some degree. Yes, some are by far more the winners, and some much more than losers than others, but the core point is that it could be used &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; anyone &lt;em&gt;by&lt;/em&gt; anyone. This creates a never-ending desperate scramble for power, as the conflicting interests of all the groups that would seek to dominate each other, or avoid domination, force them to battle for control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, as each side successively gains power, they extend the state’s powers for their own purposes, and then when the next side gains power, they usually neglect to restrict the powers of the state once more, at most simply turning the new apparatuses of control their opponents created in new directions. Additionally, with each new crisis, whether the crisis was originally created by a previous state action or power or not, leads to new calls for state action, state involvement, and new state powers thereby. Inevitably, these, too, are not retracted when the crisis evaporates, and in many cases the crisis doesn’t even evaporate, instead it just goes on, and on, and &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt;, often extended by state actions, often aided by a shift on goalposts. Thus, state power always grows, and rarely shrinks - two steps forward, one step back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus we see, as Tucker said, that any violation of the maximum equal liberty of all in society, and the mutuality and reciprocal benefit of relations therein, is inherently a threat to society itself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The history of humanity has been largely one long and gradual discovery of the fact that the individual is the gainer by society exactly in proportion as society is free, and of the law that the condition of a permanent and harmonious society is the greatest amount of individual liberty compatible with equality of liberty. The average man of each new generation has said to himself more clearly and consciously than his predecessor: My neighbor is not my enemy, but my friend, and I am his, if we would but mutually recognize the fact. We help each other to a better, fuller, happier living; and this service might be greatly increased if we would cease to restrict, hamper, and oppress each other. Why can we not agree to let each live his own life, neither of us transgressing the limit that separates our individualities? It is by this reasoning that mankind is approaching the real social contract, which is not, as Rousseau thought, the origin of society, but rather the outcome of a long social experience, the fruit of its follies and disasters. It is obvious that this contract, this social law, developed to its perfection, excludes all aggression, all violation of equality of liberty, all invasion of every kind. Considering this contract in connection with the Anarchistic definition of the State as the embodiment of the principle of invasion, we see that the State is antagonistic to society; and, society being essential to individual life and development, the conclusion leaps to the eyes that the relation of the State to the individual and of the individual to the State must be one of hostility, enduring till the State shall perish.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-whatever-it-hath-it-hath-stolen&quot;&gt;3. Whatever It Hath It Hath Stolen&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state has many more sins, however. Next highest among them, but perhaps the one felt most painfully by those outside communities whose bodies and mutual pastimes are not as specifically targeted (such as us queer people), is the way the state enforces a rigid, cold law against all people, protecting those it deems innocent and crushing those it does not. Instead of a set of norms and resolutions to conflicts that is responsive to the social context and needs of the people involved, which weighs their interests and focuses on restitution and a resolution of the root causes that led to the conflict in the first place, the state’s justice is the justice of Procrustes’ bed - content to enforce an outcome, no matter how grotesque, no matter how destructive, and no matter how blind, and call it a day, satisfying the crowded onlookers drunk on its claims of fairness and objectivity, who will then go home thinking the problem is solved. This justice is merely a band-aid, however, a thin coat of plaster over a wider crack. It eliminates the symptoms wherever they pop up, often with brutal relish, but has no concern for the underlying sickness - and through its myths, it encourages the populace to be satisfied with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the laws that it chooses to enforce are often clearly designed to serve the rich and powerful - the richer or more influential they are, the better they serve you. The fullest extent of the claims to property of the rich man is enforced against even the smallest claim of the mother who cannot afford baby formula to feed her child, because &lt;em&gt;the rules are sacred&lt;/em&gt;. The Law presents a grotesque appearance of impartiality - equality under the law - but its relevance and protectiveness clearly, in effect, scales unequally. Property laws grant little autonomy, and little meaningful protection, to a homeless person, and in fact hurt them grievously more often than not; but to a rich person, they are the very life blood that flows through their veins, elevating them to a godlike status. In an anarchist society, few would have an interest in supporting such laws, and would resist them, along with their mutual defense associations, and without the state’s power at their back, the would-be rich, the would-be powerful would quickly find it far too costly to enforce their will at risk of life, limb, and ongoing resource drainage; thus, the only norms that would prevail would be ones that are truly mutually beneficial to all, which truly grant equal autonomy for everyone. Of what benefit is it to me to support norms that protect absentee property? I do not have any - nor does anyone I know, nor would it be possible for that to change. On the contrary, absentee property is a norm which only hurts me and all those I care about, subjecting us to the whims of landlords and capitalists, draining us with rent and stealing the product of our labor. In contrast, everyone has possessions, and wishes to protect them - thus, possessions, but not property, might arise as valid mutual norms. Only the state can so efficiently, with its unilateral power, protect absentee property, that it becomes possible, and even profitable, for some to hold it, and use it to dominate others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this brings me to the final sin of the state: taxation. Although &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.alexisdumas.org/2022/05/12/theft.html&quot;&gt;I have great sympathy for certain kinds of theft&lt;/a&gt; (such as shoplifting), which is performed by stealth and cunning, taxation is committed by outright armed robbery: render unto Caesar, or die. The muzzle of a gun, as always, is the state’s ultimate threat should you not consent: first it will send letters; then it will send lawyers; finally, it will send men to kidnap you, and, if you should resist that, a beating and the muzzle of a gun await you. Moreover, while shoplifting is something that merely happens, and the conflict of it is resolved after the fact, if it is even noticed at all, taxation is institutionalized and legitimized, enforced as the right of the state, not merely something that happened, which must be frankly confronted and may be let slide after the fact. This gives it an entirely different character: instead of it being merely a natural risk, something which people recognize people may do, it becomes an imposed threat. In that, further properties of taxation lie as well: as an imposed threat, it does not represent the free and autonomous assertion of certain marginalized interests against the interests of those whose interests are already well-represented; instead, taxation represents the will of those who are already privileged, an exercise of power and caprice, to loot what they please from the population. They decide what to take, and how much, and what to use it for - they hold the ultimate decisions, so even if they deign to direct some of their tribute toward ‘humane’ causes such as welfare, it is still an exercise of privilege, &lt;em&gt;noblesse oblige&lt;/em&gt; at best, not the actual assertion of the interests of the marginalized. No matter what, it remains the assertion of the interests of the powerful. Moreover, because it is a threat, taxation is levied not only against those who barely notice it, who have more than enough, but against those who will certainly notice it with great pain. Even progressive taxation does not overcome this fact - the state steals the labor of the common worker, often a large portion of it. Thus, while theft itself is not always wrong, the state’s theft is the theft of the robber and highwayman, not the poor shoplifter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-coldly-it-lieth-also&quot;&gt;4. Coldly It Lieth Also&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of these accusations - the strident egoist asking for a justification, a reason that she knows cannot be given - asking by what right the state dictates our lives to us, the state’s worshippers will claim that we agreed to let it do this to us. What an absurdity! Appealing to democracy or the ‘social contract’ is merely misdirection, an appeal for the validity of one fixed idea to another fixed idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is democracy, but the rule of the majority over the minority? What does it matter to me, if more people proclaim an interest contrary to mine, and wish to subjugate me? By what mystical transmutation does the multitude lay claim to “ought” - to a requirement in others to obey it, a &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; to be obeyed - when none of the individuals that compose it could lay claim to it? Their interest must be weighed equally to mine. An assembly of individuals does not give birth to a wholly new entity with entirely new metaphysical properties that are beyond what any philosophical construct has been able to lay claim to - an “ought” that cannot be dismissed as a phantom. I will not accept, celebrate, or sanctify my own servitude to the collectivity. Why should I celebrate a system that requires the subordination of my interests, instead of their equal consideration and therein the preservation of my autonomy? Perhaps, as now, their force will be greater, and then I will acquiesce to subjugation out of necessity, but that to celebrate it would be to give in, to die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither is my vote in such a democracy “consent” to it. If I am notified that, without my asking for such a system to be put in place, whether I like it or not, a ruler (or a law, in a direct democracy) will be placed over me based on the votes of the majority of the people in this arbitrary territorial area, it is only self-defense for me to vote. As Lysander Spooner says in &lt;em&gt;The Constitution of No Authority&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In truth, in the case of individuals, their actual voting is not to be taken as proof of consent, even for the time being. On the contrary, it is to be considered that, without his consent having even been asked a man finds himself environed by a government that he cannot resist; a government that forces him to pay money, render service, and forego the exercise of many of his natural rights, under peril of weighty punishments. He sees, too, that other men practise this tyranny over him by the use of the ballot. He sees further, that, if he will but use the ballot himself, he has some chance of relieving himself from this tyranny of others, by subjecting them to his own. In short, he finds himself, without his consent, so situated that, if he use the ballot, he may become a master; if he does not use it, he must become a slave. And he has no other alternative than these two. In self-defence, he attempts the former. His case is analogous to that of a man who has been forced into battle, where he must either kill others, or be killed himself. Because, to save his own life in battle, a man attempts to take the lives of his opponents, it is not to be inferred that the battle is one of his own choosing. Neither in contests with the ballot—which is a mere substitute for a bullet—because, as his only chance of self-preservation, a man uses a ballot, is it to be inferred that the contest is one into which he voluntarily entered…&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A democracy, in other words, is no less subjugation of the individual than slavery&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, nor is participation in it a mechanism by which the consent of the governed can be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The social contract is no more convincing. What relevance does a contract that I had no hand in drawing up have to me? It does not, and cannot, represent my beliefs or interests, and so therefore fails at the primary purpose of a contract: mutual consideration. Leaving aside that being forced to uphold any contract by violence is inimical to autonomy -  “specific performance” is a form of slavery - even &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; the bourgeois capitalist logic of the contract, what possible reason could be found for me to be subjugated to a contract I never signed? The only reason that I can imagine to follow such a contract is the blunt one of violence: obey, or we will hurt you. But I already know and admit that the state lays this choice before me; this does not provide a reason that I should accept it, treat it with the sacred reverence that others do!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, if I had ever had a hand in drawing up the contract, and consented to it, wouldn’t its protections have been reciprocal - the benefits equally distributed? What possible interest could I have in choosing to protect and legitimize property over possession, when all of us possess things, but only a few own them, and those that do use them to lord it over the rest of us? What interest could I have in maintaining such social relations - not just acquiescing to the violence that protects them, but &lt;em&gt;praising&lt;/em&gt; them? To quote Proudhon,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But I wish that this consent, of which so much is made, had been given, either tacitly or formally. What would have been the result? Evidently, the surrenders would have been reciprocal; no right would have been abandoned without the receipt of an equivalent in exchange. We thus come back to equality again, — the sine qua non of appropriation; so that, after having justified property by universal consent, that is, by equality, we are obliged to justify the inequality of conditions by property. Never shall we extricate ourselves from this dilemma. Indeed, if, in the terms of the social compact, property has equality for its condition, at the moment when equality ceases to exist, the compact is broken and all property becomes usurpation. We gain nothing, then, by this pretended consent of mankind.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A clever philosopher may object that while I may not have explicitly signed my consent onto the so-called “social contract,” I provided my &lt;em&gt;tacit&lt;/em&gt; consent by using government services. Of course, again, the voting objection applies - had I been given a choice, I would have gone elsewhere for such services, or gone without them. (I would gladly do without the tender care of the police force!) But the government has stolen money that would have gone to the services of my choice to provide these services to me whether I asked for them or not, and, further, it has used its violence to shut out anyone else from providing alternative services, either similar or vastly different. The very laws it enforces against us prevent alternative norms and social bonds from forming that would make participating in the capitalist economy it protects obsolete. It has done all this to force me to use the services it provides, and then turned around and used that forced &lt;em&gt;acquiescence&lt;/em&gt; as proof of my consent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about &lt;em&gt;hypothetical&lt;/em&gt; consent - truly, we are drifting farther and farther into unreality, into speculative metaphysics, indeed, into sophistry, to justify the state! - would, if we were all unbiased actors, possessed of perfect reason, and no value but pure self-interest, would we have agreed to this or another social order? Well, perhaps, and perhaps not - such a human being is psychologically impossible, an absurdity: a person having no values, desires, except self-interest? Self-interest in what? How, in what way? A person knowing nothing but the laws of sociology and economics, but nothing of themselves? Ha! Even if such a person &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; choose a state, however, the point is moot. I am not unconscious, or a vegetable, or a newborn baby, that only hypothetical consent matters to - it is a pale shadow in comparison to my real, vital, strident, and informed &lt;em&gt;non&lt;/em&gt;-consent! It would be a sick joke to treat anyone how one believes they would &lt;em&gt;hypothetically&lt;/em&gt; consent, in spite of them begging you to stop. This is no exception. I will not accept being bound by what one philosopher believes a psychologically impossible absurdity would consent to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-with-stolen-teeth-it-biteth&quot;&gt;5. With Stolen Teeth It Biteth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the state is so transparently evil, so destructive of the highest and mightiest of the things that humanity has yet owned - autonomy! - how can it possibly endure? Not by pure repression, that much is certain. Instead, the state endures by virtue of two key advantages: indoctrination, and temporal primacy. Without these two crucial weapons, the state could not endure, and without the first, the state could never arise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indoctrination is the cornerstone of the state’s foundation, the crucial conduit through which all its power runs. If we, the people subjugated by it, did not cooperate, by following its laws, by calling its servants when others violated them, by filing our paperwork so that it could monitor us, and allowing its “police” to walk through our streets, if we were every day and every hour violating its commands, it could not long endure - it would have to have a cop for every person, maybe two or three, and that is clearly not the case. The state cannot survive and ensure obedience by pure repression; instead, it convinces people that following the law is always good, and violating it always bad; that the state is the ultimate arbiter of right and wrong, that being a good citizen is a moral duty, and that it serves the people, and the cops protect them. Moreover, the state requires a great amount of labor for its support. If all at once we refused to sell resources to it, refused to work for it, the proclamations of politicians would mean little more than those of the man in the psych ward who claims to be Napoleon, and is laughed off by the nurses. As Etienne de la Boetie eloquently cried in &lt;em&gt;Discourse of Voluntary Servitude&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;All this havoc, this misfortune, this ruin, descends upon you not from alien foes, but from the one enemy whom you yourselves render as powerful as he is, for whom you go bravely to war, for whose greatness you do not refuse to offer your own bodies unto death. He who thus domineers over you has only two eyes, only two hands, only one body, no more than is possessed by the least man among the infinite numbers dwelling in your cities; he has indeed nothing more than the power that you confer upon him to destroy you. Where has he acquired enough eyes to spy upon you, if you do not provide them yourselves? How can he have so many arms to beat you with, if he does not borrow them from you? The feet that trample down your cities, where does he get them if they are not your own? How does he have any power over you except through you? How would he dare assail you if he had no cooperation from you? What could he do to you if you yourselves did not connive with the thief who plunders you, if you were not accomplices of the murderer who kills you, if you were not traitors to yourselves?&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we could but countermand the propaganda of the state, an insurrection would begin which no state could survive - all across the world, people would realize within themselves their Unique, and stand up, refusing to bow to the whims of others:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…The egoist has always affirmed himself with crime and, with sacrilegious hand, has pulled the sacred idols down from their pedestals. It is necessary to put an end to the sacred; or better still: the need to violate the sacred must become general…&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly it’s not just indoctrination that causes people to submit to the state. For some, the rich and powerful, the state actively works for their benefit, but crucially, for many others, there is a subtler motivation: the status quo is &lt;em&gt;comfortable&lt;/em&gt;. It may not be better for them than the alternative vision of the future I propose, but it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; good enough that there aren’t isn’t a sharp ache in their hearts pushing them forward, driving them to rage against the system, to raise their fists to the powers that be. Their bellies are full, their minds occupied with whatever flight of fancy pleases them, and they see no reason to push beyond that. They have left their will to power behind. They willingly choose the life of the comfortable caged pet over the free animal. This is not to say that these people are inherently slothful, or evil, or anything like that; far be it from me to make such accusations, when I too feel this pull, as the comfortably well-taken-care-of daughter of a rich father. No, it’s merely a matter of incentives and awareness. There is nothing that hits close to home, for them, about the struggles the state causes, because it does not personally effect them enough to really hurt. Because of that, they are not by themselves motivated enough in the first place to become aware of the state’s oppression, and thus to become outraged by it. This is why education is so important: by making people aware, we can make them rebel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What of primacy? Well, in a society that was not already indoctrinated into the legitimacy of some ruler - maybe not exactly a state, but a village elder, or a priest, or a god - it would be very difficult to obtain the power of a state. It would, in effect, be a chicken and egg problem: without already-existing control over society through which to enforce obedience and obtain resources, how can one obtain enough resources to enforce obedience? If I can’t defend my absentee property or stockpiled riches, I can’t pay anyone to defend them, and I can’t amass power either. Moreover, even if I do begin to gather power, forces in society can arise to counterbalance me, since I do not yet have the absolute hegemonic power of the state to suppress rivals. The state as it already exists, however, arose because people expected to be led and were willing to acquiesce to it. By that means, it gained power and wealth and resources, so that now, for any rival just starting out, it represents a gigantic, unbeatable Goliath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-false-is-everything-in-it&quot;&gt;6. False Is Everything In It&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, then, we see how true Zarathustra’s words were! The state is the ultimate social predator, a super-organism which forms a parasitic relationship with the host body of society itself. I urge all those who understand my words to resist it by any means available to them; I have contributed in what small way I can by trying to undermine the indoctrination which the state has so far managed to spread very wide.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;(systems theory) A mechanism of indirect coordination between agents or actions, in which the aftereffects of one action guide a subsequent action.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my previous essay, I mentioned how the enforcement of absolute laws, for example in the case of theft, can actually be harmful - not just to the individual punished by the retributive ‘justice’ of the state, but to the whole society, as the underlying tensions that led to the theft remain unresolved, or are (often) worsened. I argued that, in contrast to a liberal-capitalist-democratic society, an anarchist society would be aware of this problem, and, taking no fixed idea of Law or Justice as a ‘sacred idea,’ would invest instead in weighing the actual interests of those involved in the conflict and resolving the underlying tensions through restorative justice. Thus, I claimed that ‘theft would be a legitimate means of surviving.’ In this essay, I want to elaborate on that point, because I think understanding what precisely I mean by this, and what social problems it is aimed at resolving, is crucial to understanding what a humane anarchist society might look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without the ‘sacred ideas’ of Law and Justice, people in an anarchist society would look at ‘theft’ as just as inherently amoral as possession itself - neither legitimate nor illegitimate, but simply the assertion of certain interests against others. The question would be what would be necessary to resolve any social conflict caused by &lt;em&gt;either&lt;/em&gt; the assertion of possessory rights &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; the negation of them, as well as ensuring that neither interest is subordinated to each other, but each is weighed equally. Thus, although general communal norms, expressed in the personal choices and actions by most individuals in that community, might lean towards respecting the possessions of others in order to obtain reciprocal respect for one’s own possessions - i.e., in order to avoid social conflict or a free-for-all, and to maintain norms that are generally beneficial to self-determination and autonomy - it would have to be recognized that asking someone for whom such reciprocal benefits are very far down their list of interests to respect them is laughable, and a form of subjugation of their interests to the interests of the community as a whole. Thus, the whole social attitude towards theft would necessarily change from one of moralization - either against, like in the conservative view that one should never ever steal, that there is ‘always’ another option; or for, as we see occasionally in ‘leftist’ circles - to one of understanding, acceptance, and frank confrontation of accountability, ready to do what is necessary to move forward. In such a society, the clear solution to the bicycle problem presented in my previous essay would be to allow the shoplifter to keep it, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, those who, for whatever reason - mental illness, disability, or other circumstances -, could not support themselves by their own labor, would have a fallback on which to survive, by simply taking what they needed from whoever had enough that it wouldn’t harm them too much - for instance, stealing food from the local branch of the large grocery cooperative. Most of the time, this would barely be noticed, would be covered by insurance, and would be largely invisible to whoever was stolen from, and to the community at large; yet, it would mean the world for those who otherwise would be condemned to a life of poverty, hardship, and possibly even starvation. Additionally, in most cases, poverty is the product of the poverty trap, an inability to get into a stable and safe position from which one can begin to heal, to develop useful skills, and learn how to contribute to one’s community, not inherent laziness, evil, or incapacities, as many would have you believe. Most people actually want to contribute something useful to their community and not be dependent forever. Therefore, in most cases, needing to steal to survive would be a very temporary condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that there would be no incentive against theft - frank confrontation of the reasons behind theft, instead of moralization, does not preclude finding that theft is actually an unacceptable subordination of those stolen from - stealing the neighbor’s better TV, for instance. Conflict resolution in some cases might require the injuring party to give restitution of some kind to the person they stole from, or simply return the item. Moreover, even in cases of theft like the ones discussed in the previous paragraph, there is still the risk of being caught and needing to go through a whole process of conflict resolution, with accompanying social friction, delay, and so on, even if the decision comes out in the thief’s favor in the end. Therefore, I don’t think anyone would be that motivated to steal constantly and wantonly; it would likely be limited to necessities, against compassionately chosen targets, and only when the person is actually in need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This emergent property of an anarchist society would essentially act as an alternative to the welfare state. The welfare state, as we have it now, fosters centralization and dependence, by proclaiming that it is the only actor that may legitimately steal - through taxes - in order to support its citizens, ensuring that those citizens depend on it for their lives and livelihoods; to compound this, it predicates such support on bureaucratic red tape and gate-keeping which is often traumatizing to the applicants and which leaves many who need aid and support out in the cold. Moreover, once someone has obtained welfare, it is used like a carrot to control their actions, further destroying their autonomy, and the benefits themselves are often seemingly almost purposefully designed to foster and promote dependence. Unlike the welfare state, theft for those in need would distribute mis-allocated resources to the people that needed them most in a decentralized, stigmergic way. There would not be any need to gatekeep, there would be no centralized bureaucracy, nothing like that at all. Instead of the traumatizing process of being inspected and controlled and tied by the neck to the state, people would be empowered to act on their own, to simply take what they needed, and negotiate the consequences as necessary with the community around them. Instead of state ‘legitimized’ theft carried out by armed goons against the entire populace, irrespective of whether they are a large corporation or collective which could cover the loss, or a laborer, and most of which is allocated to things that would not be considered genuine interests, let alone interests that weigh well against those of the stolen-from, there would be small and occasional instances of theft here and there in a larger society, targeted against actors that would barely notice the difference. And since it wouldn’t be carried out by the state, covered in miles of rules and legislation and red tape, it would probably be far cheaper to bear the costs of such theft than it would be to actually pay for welfare!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such theft would act as a natural, almost market-like means of stigmergically redistributing wealth, preventing class segregation by ensuring that nobody sinks into the vicious cycle of poverty while others stockpile wealth. It turns the interstices of the economy in an anarchist society into a more habitable place, preventing anyone from falling through the cracks due to unavoidable circumstances. Combined with the much lower barrier to being self-sufficient in an anarchist society, as working out of your home would be possible and jobs would pay much more thanks to all being worker-owned, this all but ensures that everyone would be ‘taken care of’ without any need for a paternal/maternal state. Indeed, such theft by those in need would act as a natural incentive to those who have a lot of resources to provide resources for to aid those in need voluntarily, since the social friction caused by stealing (over and above the simple loss of the item), due to danger, possible damage to property, and the need for conflict resolution if anyone is caught, doesn’t just apply to the thief, but also whoever is stolen from. All this combines to directly incentivize exactly the sort of things that a capitalist market makes supererogatory. Collectives could provide training on the job, loosen up hiring requirements regarding e.g. work hours or dress codes, or do whatever else is necessary to lower the barrier to entry to get a job; they could also begin handing out the excess of whatever product they produce, such as food or clothes, which, thanks to the laws of supply and demand, there is likely to be. There are a myriad ways of doing this sort of thing, certainly way more than I can think of!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while I don’t think theft is ‘good’ in all cases, in certain situations, for certain people, and when handled and viewed correctly by society, I think it can actually be a very beneficial thing on many levels. I don’t claim to have perfect foresight about what a system like this would end up working like, but I do think this is an interesting thing to think about.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alexis Purslane</name></author><category term="politics" /><category term="anarchism" /><summary type="html">stigmergy (noun) (biology) A mechanism of spontaneous, indirect coordination between agents or actions, where the trace left in the environment by an action stimulates the performance of a subsequent action.

It has been developing in response to my thoughts about anarchism moving in a less market-oriented and more egoist direction, and as such it looks much more ‘socialist’ and ‘leftist’ than my previous visions ever did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new vision of anarchism, and accompanying understanding, has increasingly made my previous essays about anarchism obsolete. Furthermore, I have found myself giving nearly the following exposition to many people in nearly identical form, which indicates that it strikes at the heart of my current mentality. Considering that, I think it’s time to transcribe it into something a little more permanent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before or after you read this essay, I highly recommend you read &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.alexisdumas.org/2022/01/17/what-is-individualist-anarchism.html&quot;&gt;What Is Individualist Anarchism&lt;/a&gt;, which overlaps with this one in a few ways but in general elaborates more on values, property norms, and long term goals, but less on institutions specifically. I view these essays as essentially two sides of the same coin, and the way I phrase my ideas in one or the other my make more sense to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-conflict-resolution&quot;&gt;1. Conflict Resolution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary problem of ‘organization’ in an anarchist society is conflict resolution. The fullest extent of each person’s interests are always, at least at the borders, going to come into conflict with those of others, since the full satisfaction of everyone’s desires is not possible. This naturally leads to conflict, but that conflict itself is expensive and generally undesirable compared to a state of reconciliation and cooperation, since it imposes material and interpersonal costs. Thus, it is in everyone’s interests to have some means of resolving the conflicts that arise of necessity as part of living among other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One solution to such conflicts is to subordinate the interests of one party of the conflict to the other. This does not resolve the conflict, but instead anoints one side as ‘legitimate’ and the other as ‘illegitimate’ and perpetuates an eternal war against the ‘illegitimate’ side in the name of ‘ending’ (really, disguising) the conflict. This is the solution which most societies throughout human history, since the creation of the state by the first priest or warlord, have pursued, because it is the easiest. Instead of actually giving up anything, resolving anything, or reconciling anything, one side gets everything they want, and wages constant conflict on the other side, which is cowed, defeated, indoctrinated, repressed, confused, and loaded full of sacred ideas to protect the authority and legitimacy of the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another solution is to subordinate the interests of both sides to a ‘sacred idea’ such as Law, or Equality, or Justice. This is the idea behind most modern representative democracies, and it, too, is easy; instead of resolving the conflict, it pushes down, hides, ‘ends’ the conflict by meting out punishments and rewards so that people can feel satisfied, as if something has been accomplished, and leaves it at that. Of course the underlying causes of the conflict are not resolved, and nothing is fixed or healed by this method, and so, inevitably, it reduces to the first method of conflict resolution: an eternal war on the part of society, on behalf of the class that happens to be privileged by the Laws that are constructed, against those who are disenfranchised by it. This, too, is no real solution; such a centralized, rigid legal system is, despite statist myth-making, more damaging to its host society than beneficial. It is a band-aid, a Procrustean bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, imagine that someone shoplifts a bicycle. In a modern liberal-capitalist-democratic society, such a person would likely be fined and/or sent to jail - after having the vehicle taken away, of course. Is this truly the right solution? If someone was in such terrible need as to risk social conflict to obtain the bicycle, maybe they need it - maybe allowing them to keep it would allow them to obtain transportation to a job, which would help raise them out of poverty. This is a classic problem with poverty, after all: it takes resources to get into a position to make money, and without money this can turn into an unsolvable chicken-and-egg problem without resorting to ‘illegal’ actions. Moreover, stealing a cheap bicycle from your average supermarket store, like Target, is barely a blip on their radar, whereas protecting their property by preventing such theft, and even &lt;em&gt;punishing&lt;/em&gt; the thief, can be an utterly disastrous thing for the thief. The assertion of the fullest extent of the corporation’s minor interest over the desperate needs of the thief is a clear subordination of the latter’s interests to the former, a grotesque decision. Not only does doing so merely perpetuate the social conflict, without resolving any of the underlying problems, it increases it, as someone who was merely poor before now gets kidnapped, put in a cage, and has this ‘put on their record.’ This is why, incidentally, recidivism rates are so high after prison - how is someone supposed to get back on their feet after having their life utterly destroyed in such a way? And hence the conflict worsens, and the cops get more militarized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, since an anarchist ‘society,’ by definition, rejects such systemic violence, subordination of the interests of some to others, and adherence to the law as a fixed sacred idea, the focus must inevitably be on the actual resolution of conflicts &lt;em&gt;between the parties to the conflict&lt;/em&gt;, and nothing else. The interests of both parties are all that is relevant to such an endeavor, and the resolution of the conflict by finding a mutually beneficial and satisfactory end must be the only goal. Although the resolution can be informed by social norms and values, this is only through the reaction of the community at large - at least, those who are aware of the conflict - to the resolution of the conflict, and the beliefs and values of the parties that are involved, insofar as they have internalized any social norms or values. No set of norms or values can be elevated to a position of a ‘sacred idea’ over the actual interests of those involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this model, some conflicts may not be resolvable; sometimes, the cost of social war is less to each involved party than the cost of accepting any compromise whatsoever. In such a case, conflict is inevitable, and that’s okay. Such a situation can only arise, in my opinion, when one side is attempting to unilaterally subordinate the interests of another: the would-be master requires surrender from the slave, and the slave cannot accept this. We are, in a sense, in just such a situation now - no ‘resolution’ to the conflict between the rich and powerful and everyone else is possible; the former must be eliminated (not by killing them, to be clear, but by taking away their power).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on this, instead of a set system of courts and judges, with bureaucratic procedures and state enforcement, in an anarchist society I envision a system where conflicts are first and foremost resolved by face to face communication between the aggrieved parties, or through the mediation of family members, neighbors, or friends. However, in response to occasions when these fail, perhaps because the aggrieved parties don’t trust any of the people listed previously to mediate the dispute evenhandedly, a class of wandering, competing arbitrators could arise to serve the required social function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They could be aware of the way previous arbitrators had resolved similar disputes, perhaps compiling lists of history and tradition that they thought aligned with their personal philosophies, but they would be primarily concerned with arriving at a solution &lt;em&gt;in their particular situation&lt;/em&gt;, for the specific needs of the people involved. Their job would not be to ‘hand down’ a final decision - any number of other people could always be consulted for a second opinion - or be the mouthpiece of some absolute law, and their decisions would not be enforced unless the people involved themselves found them worthy of enforcing. Such arbitrators’ only job would be to try to use their broad experience with resolving conflicts and their speaking and arguing ability to find some mutually agreeable solution so that social conflict can end. In essence, they would be trying to find some unique point in the ongoing bargain between the two parties that would be better for both of them, and the primary enforcement of their ideas would be, if they are successful in their job, the fact that such reconciliation is better than ongoing conflict for everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sort of approach to resolving conflicts in society has some historical precedent; it is, in fact, fairly similar to the &lt;em&gt;filid&lt;/em&gt; of Ancient Ireland:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;First of all, the law itself was based upon immemorial custom passed down orally through a class of professional jurists known as the &lt;em&gt;filid&lt;/em&gt;. These jurists added glosses to the basic law from time to time to make it fit the needs of the times; several schools of jurisprudence existed, and the professional jurists were consulted by parties to disputes for advice as to what the law was in particular cases, and these same men often acted as arbitrators between suitors. They remained at all times private persons, not public officials; their functioning depended upon their knowledge of the law and the integrity of their judicial reputations. They are the only “judges” Celtic Ireland knew; their jurisprudence was her only law, national in scope, and completely detached from the &lt;em&gt;tuath&lt;/em&gt;, the kings and their respective wishes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;How was this law of the &lt;em&gt;filid&lt;/em&gt; enforced? The law was enforced by the action of private individuals allied with the plaintiff and defendant through a system of sureties. Men were linked together by a number of individual relationships by which they were obligated to stand surety for one another guaranteeing that wrongs would be righted, debts paid, judgments honored, and the law enforced.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although historical precedent is not absolute, and we should dare to dream beyond the limits of what has been done before, instead of confining ourselves to mere cannibalism of the past, historical parallels to suggested projectual anarchist ideas are, in my opinion, very useful in demonstrating that such ideas are possible and can arise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-protection&quot;&gt;2. Protection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, not all social conflict is amenable to resolution. There will probably be those who don’t want to try to solve a conflict by a mutually-agreed-upon compromise of some kind, but want to take whatever they please from others by force, because they think they’re stronger. There is also violent crime to consider, and attacks on a community from the outside. Furthermore, although the fact that resolutions to conflicts are mutually beneficial, and ongoing conflict in a community is costly and destabilizing, will usually be enough to motivate compliance, sometimes decisions made and agreed to in arbitration will need some mechanism of enforcement. To a large degree, diffuse social sanctions can suffice for this; refusing to trade with people, disassociating from them, or criticizing them in ways that can damage their reputation, are actually powerful motivators, and it has the added benefit of allowing each person in the community to make their own decision as to someone’s guilt or innocence and the degree of it, which means no need for central community councils or anything. Nevertheless, sometimes a little more is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all these purposes, I suggest mutual defense associations. These could be composed of, and in turn controlled cooperatively by, the people whom they existed to protect. In other words, these mutual defense associations could be composed of part-time volunteers, maybe rotating by some schedule or maybe just being called into service by proximity, from the community, that answer to the needs of the other people in their community and can call each other up for help as well. By this means, everyone would band together to protect, or come to the aid of, any one of their members, in return for the willingness of the others to do so for each of them, in classic mutual aid fashion. There could be multiple overlapping such institutions, with different bylaws and membership, etc, for each community, not locked down to any territory, nor enacting any set of rigid laws, but merely operating on the basis of the needs of the people in them. They might have rules that their members have to follow to remain a part of the association and gain the benefits therein, or you might get the benefits of the associations imply for being part of the community. There are a myriad of different ways to do it, all equally valid for different situations and communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One possible concern might be that such mutual defense associations might turn into states, but I don’t think that such a situation is any great risk. Without sacred ideas legitimizing the rule of any particular institution, it would be very difficult for any would-be state to grab much power, as everyone would begin leaving it, refusing to pay dues, refusing to obey orders, and joining other mutual defense associations to counteract it. Trying to force every single person within its claimed territory, or even a significant fraction of them, to obey its orders would be a Herculean, or perhaps better yet Sisyphean, task. After all, the state does not perpetuate itself by sheer repression, but through indoctrination into sacred ideas such as ‘law’ and ‘social contract’ and ‘legitimacy,’ as well as a show of intimidation through its police and armies which would nevertheless not be enough to actually control the whole population. Without already having a population indoctrinated in these ideas - as humans have been for millennia, and which we have seen in every so-called ‘power vacuum’ after a state falls - and without already being established and able to levy taxes in order to bolster its resources, a mutual defense association would find it an uphill battle indeed to &lt;em&gt;gain&lt;/em&gt; such resources through taxes, or achieve such an indoctrinated populace, and become anything more than just another gang or organized crime syndicate. Moreover, such a rogue mutual defense association would be a threat to everyone in an anarchist society, so it wouldn’t be unlikely for other mutual defense associations to rush in to disabuse the burgeoning state of its grandiose notions. Thus, a power balance can be achieved through decentralization, where everything balances against each other. In a sense, an anarchist society is a stable equilibrium: perhaps difficult to get into from other equilibrium, but once you’re there, stable enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefit of such a system is that, unlike cops, mutual defense associations wouldn’t be an occupying army that ‘descends from above,’ alien to the communities they patrol, designed to enforce laws deaf to the norms and needs of the communities they walk through. They would be of, by, for, and accountable to the people that they &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; serve and protect. It would be something everyone in the community could take a part in, and a part time affair at that, meaning that everyone who did would be fully part of the community, with other jobs to weave them into it. Thus there would be no special class that performs functions of defense and peace-keeping, which views itself as separate from and superior to everyone else. No more “sheep,” “sheepdogs” and “wolves.” It would just be members of the community doing each other a service, not because it’s their job, but because they get something out of it too. Members of such associations, being members of their community, could also be held accountable for their actions if necessary via the same diffuse social sanctions and even, if necessary, force, that every other member of the community would be subject to. Without the special privileges of authority, they would not be viewed with undue respect, and thus would not benefit from the same lack of accountability as cops. And aren’t the people who use violence in society to protect others those &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; in need of proper accountability and limits, of being forced to be careful and considerate and slow to anger and violence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, since protectors are just volunteers who, otherwise, are like anyone else, such associations couldn’t claim a monopoly on helping other members of the community. Any member of the community could act to protect the others, so if you saw someone in need of help or protection, you could do what you needed to do, without fear of reprisal from “the authorities.” Of course, if you judged the situation wrong or acted too brutally or whatever, the community could hold you accountable just that same as anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, since these MDAs would be composed of members of the communities they protected, minorities and oppressed classes could have their own MDAs serving their own interests, counterbalancing the power of majorities.  (Imbalances in numbers could easily be made up for with modern military technology such as automatic weapons.) No longer would we have to live in a system where the majority or the minority gets to dictate what happens to everyone, opening up the gates to oppression. People with different interests could abide by different rules and live in different ways, disassociating from each other if necessary, but, as long as live and let live attitudes prevail, living together as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, these communities would not need to ‘win’ any conflict &lt;em&gt;outright&lt;/em&gt;, in the sense that states must absolutely crush their enemies, but only make the conflict costly enough to the people trying to oppress them for it to not be worth it. In turn, because of this structure, that threshold would be far less than under a state: the state is an incredibly efficient, centralized system for enforcement of laws which is considered legitimate, and therefore cooperated with, by nearly everyone in society, and which has no competitors, and has the ability to tax everyone in society, even those it seeks to oppress. It even maintains a separate class of people to actually do its dirty work, separating the people who make the decisions to oppress people from actually having to invest any time, energy, resources, or their own lives in actually enforcing their decisions. MDAs share none of these features - there are competitors, they don’t have sole legitimacy, they can’t tax anyone, let alone everyone, and the people making the decisions are also responsible for carrying them out. How many Republicans do you think would find it worth it to legislate against trans healthcare, for instance, if they actually had to get up out of their armchairs and manhandle doctors and kidnap trans children?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such mutual defense associations could also double as insurance agencies, pooling resources through dues paid by the members that can afford to do so not only for weapons, armor, and training for those that don’t already have them, but also to have a pool of money to pay any reparations that may be assigned to any of their members in case they can’t pay themselves. This would provide a way of avoiding even more conflicts, of course, and taking the burden of reparations off people who may not be doing so well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systems similar to this have also existed in history, such as the &lt;em&gt;borh&lt;/em&gt; system of ancient England:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For purposes of security, the most important social unit was the borh. A borh was an association, typically of twelve people, who stood surety for one another’s good behavior. If a member of a borh committed a crime, the other members were committed to bringing him to justice — but also to helping him pay restitution for his crime. (Financial restitution rather than retribution was the normal sentence for most crimes; those who refused to pay restitution were outlawed, that is, placed outside the law — meaning that anyone could kill them with impunity.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The borh may have originated as a kinship group, but if so, its kin-based aspects soon dwindled; at the height of the Anglo-Saxon system, borhs were purely contractual arrangements. Individuals were free to apply to a borh of their choosing, and members of that borh were likewise free to accept or refuse the applicant; once accepted, an individual was free to leave, and could also be expelled. Since the members of the borh would be held responsible for one another’s actions, there was a strong incentive to police members’ behavior. Likewise, there was a strong incentive to belong to a borh and not be kicked out, because few were willing to deal with someone who belonged to no borh; such a person was in effect an uninsured risk, since he had no fellow borh-members standing surety for him. The borh system thus created powerful incentives for responsible behavior.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another similar system existed in England much later as well, although it focused more on the absolute enforcement of laws and (were forced to) use(d) government courts for prosecution, which obviously wouldn’t work, let alone be acceptable, in an anarchist society:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But before the reign of the Bobbies, English law enforcement relied heavily on organizations known as Associations for the Prosecution of Felons — also known as thief-takers’ associations. Imagine a cross between a Neighborhood Watch group, an insurance agency, and an Old West style posse. People in a particular neighborhood would pool their resources, and supply their own labor, to support their local thief-takers’ association. The association would keep its eyes open for robbers (particularly those who robbed houses displaying the plaque of association membership!). If a crime (against an association member) did occur, the association would hunt down, or pay to have hunted down, the wrongdoer, often cooperating with similar associations in other districts — and then use the pooled resources to pay for the felon’s prosecution in a government court. (Criminal justice was not free in those days.)&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-norms&quot;&gt;3. Norms&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, what sorts of general norms do I think are likely to emerge in an anarchist society that used the sorts of systems I’m proposing? To be quite frank, that’s a question that cannot possibly be wholly answered - in a society that is focused on the needs and interests of the actual individuals involved in conflicts, coming up with norms that serve them, and avoiding hierarchy, domination, and authority instead of enforcing a law or a plan, the norms would be different, sometimes subtly, sometimes drastically, in every place, and even from time to time in the same place. However, if the positive emphasis of anarchism is on self-determination and autonomy, the positive mirror image of domination and subordination, I can venture some guesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, I think that traditional property norms would have to disappear. Property, in allowing for absentee dominion over resources which one does not use but which other people do, directly conflicts with self-determination and autonomy, and directly serves domination: if you use something, rely on it for your life in some way, have your interests tied up in it, and yet someone else controls it, that creates a relationship of dependency from you to them which is imbalanced, because you have no control and they have all the control, and they (the owner) can exploit that to control you. We see this sort of relationship between e.g. the capitalist and their workers, or the landlord and their tenants. The absentee owner ‘uses’ their property only to gain dominion over others through state-backed violence, that is the only use they have for it and the only interest they have tied up in it, and interests that require domination are not to be respected in an anarchist society. Refusing them such a ‘right’ to absentee property only serves to prevent domination. Meanwhile, the occupiers and users of such property, if given primacy, take nothing real away from the ‘owner’, just as stepping into a place on the sidewalk which your friend will never set foot in, nor use themself, does not take anything away from them, whereas if they try to prevent you from walking down the sidewalk to somewhere you need to go, they are robbing you of some liberty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, property does perform some functions that might be useful to protect autonomy in an anarchist society, in allowing the individual to separate herself form the collectivity, so that she does not become dominated by it in the same way she was dominated by the state or the capitalist, beholden to it through dependence on its resources and subjugated to the wills of many others instead of a few. This is why Proudhon said both “property is theft” and “property is liberty.” To quote Proudhon from &lt;em&gt;Theory of Property&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Property is not measured by merit, as it is neither wages, nor reward, nor decoration, nor honorific title; it is not measured by the power of the individual, since labor, production, credit and exchange do not require it at all. It is a free gift, accorded to man, with a view to protecting him against the attacks of poverty and the incursions of his fellows. It is the breastplate of his personality and equality, independent of differences in talent, genius, strength, industry, etc.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where occupancy and use possession comes into play: granting ‘ownership’ of things - the ‘right’ to have primary say in the use of something - to those who actually use or occupy those things and thus have their interests bound up in them, actually &lt;em&gt;bolsters&lt;/em&gt; self-determination, by ensuring that each person has control over the things they depend on, instead of being at the mercy of others. Physical possessions, such as houses, tools, and other things, independent of their fuzzy and ill-defined status as ‘means of production’ - but this relation is perhaps even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; intense for means of production that can be used individually - are often practically direct extensions of a person, and vitally important to ensuring that they are able to act towards their own goals and exercise self-determination. Through protecting this sort of relationship to any physical object, unlike in anarcho-communism which only respects it for objects that can’t be used to produce things, the individual is made capable of separating themselves from the collectivity, so that the collectivity does not become an absentee, dominating force over them. If they, for instance, can operate some means of production productively by themselves, and in fact do so, there is no need to force them to relinquish that means to the collectivity; allowing them to have their means of working for themselves grants greater autonomy. Likewise, having one’s own resources means one is not at the mercy of anyone else, even a democratic collective - one’s own home, say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this is not re-instating capitalist property: since &lt;em&gt;all those&lt;/em&gt; who have an interest in something, or who use it, have an equal claim by this logic, shared means of production, for instance, which all use and all maintain, are the property of the group that collectively maintains and uses them; likewise, the products of labor are the property of all those who cooperated to produce it where the relations of mutual aid and cooperation involved in the process of production weren’t broken up by trade to alienate any claims to the products of production; similarly, all those who live in a house own it, all those who regularly work in a field share claim to it, etc. For any one person who uses or occupies things to claim sole possessory rights to it would be to make all the other users dependent on them, and defeat the whole point, not to mention being simply arbitrary. Any decisions made regarding shared objects must either be individual, but not likely to effect the use of others - so if you use a factory machine, maintain it and leave it ready for another to use, and don’t try to use it while someone else is - in the manner of usufructuary, or must be done with the express consent of the others who use the object, either directly (consensus democracy) or through some means agreed-upon beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I do not see any reason to think that even occupancy and use possession will be taken as an absolute law or ‘sacred idea’ to be enforced with prejudice and unilaterally; as I said before, in an anarchist society, conflict resolution is the focus, not Law or Justice (revenge). As such, possession will be protected in the community only insofar as having it as a norm is mutually beneficial to all, a second-order set of ‘rules of thumb’ which are responsive to the underlying needs of the society. If the respect for possession is based on the reciprocal gain to each individual of having their own possessions respected, than if the possessory claims of one set of people become onerous enough, or another set has nothing of their own anyway, then the incentive to respect such possessory titles would evaporate, and they would just take what they need. After all, saying “I will respect you and all your possessions” to a homeless or starving person is utterly laughable as a promise for which to expect anything in return! Likewise, promising to respect the possessions of another when you own everything is stupid and they would have no reason to respect that. Crucially, this wouldn’t just be on an individual level: in an anarchist society, any ‘violations’ of possessory claims would be recognized as no more or less inherently ‘legitimate’ than the claims themselves, and the lack of interests on the part of the violating parties in respecting the possessions of the other party would have to be recognized, and their interests in the objects they took examined and weighed. Thus, the people resolving such disputes would have to focus on making sure the violators gained an interest in supporting general possessory norms, insuring that they no longer need to violate them, in order to resolve the conflict.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this implies, when worked out in the long run, I can’t say for sure. Personally, I envision an economy dominated by local, community-based worker- and consumer- cooperatives, joined and regulated by federations where the power flows from the &lt;em&gt;bottom up&lt;/em&gt; instead of the top down like in a representative democracy (i.e. an elective aristocracy); the gaps between these cooperatives would be filled by independent artisans using advanced home manufacturing equipment, embedded in a market freed from the cash nexus so that people can barter or exchange using whatever they have, or operate on (interest free) debt or credit. I would expect people to claim empty property and build what they need out of what is available to them, so few would be homeless, as they could simply squat unused buildings or build on unused land; likewise, without licensing and regulation, as well as the overbearing control of landlords, people could run businesses doing whatever they know how to do - from hair braiding to cooking - out of their own homes if they needed to. In such an economy, I don’t think there would be anyone, no matter how ‘disabled’ that wouldn’t be able to contribute something, and since they would work on their own terms and receive the full product of their labor, responsible for their labor time, it would be far more fulfilling and worth it. For those who truly couldn’t support themselves, mutual aid would probably be widespread, as well as the distribution of all excess production, which the state currently forces corporations to throw out instead of providing to people&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, to those who need it; on top of that, as I discussed before, ‘theft’ would be a legitimate way to survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I can’t plan out an anarchist society ahead of time, nor do I want to. Nevertheless, I hope I’ve sketched a promising picture of how the basic substructure of such a society could work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Alexis Purslane</name></author><category term="politics" /><category term="anarchism" /><summary type="html">A new vision of an anarchist society, different in important ways from the ones that I’ve presented before, replete with new emphases and contrasts with the society that we currently live in, has been percolating in the back of my head for some time. It has been developing in response to my thoughts about anarchism moving in a less market-oriented and more egoist direction, and as such it looks much more ‘socialist’ and ‘leftist’ than my previous visions ever did.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">On Faith and Normativity</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2022/02/25/faith.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="On Faith and Normativity" /><published>2022-02-25T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2022-02-25T00:00:00-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2022/02/25/faith</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2022/02/25/faith.html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a moral subjectivist, I view the only conceivable normative force someone could have to be their own personal desires and motivations. Outside of that, there is nothing that can even coherently be said to impose a duty, or an obligation, or an absolute requirement, on anyone. To briefly summarize my reasons for this, I ask you to consider what it would mean for a normative proposition to be “true.” We can say that a traditional factual proposition is true if it accurately describes one’s experiences, or accurately predicts experiences, or if it corresponds to some objective world — there are many coherent interpretations of what that sort of proposition means. But what can a normative proposition be true with respect to? What standard could we arrive at? Normative propositions are &lt;em&gt;commands&lt;/em&gt;, they say what one ought or ought not to do — what does it mean for it to be “true” that someone ought or ought not do something? That certainly doesn’t correspond to a state of affairs, it doesn’t describe an experience, and it certainly doesn’t predict anything. The only sense in which a normative statement can be said to be “true” is if it is &lt;em&gt;binding&lt;/em&gt; — i.e. if there are sufficient reasons to make it rational to adhere to it and irrational not to. In this sense, I would say that normative propositions are actually normative &lt;em&gt;statements.&lt;/em&gt; This is a fundamentally different kind of thing than a factual claim: the truth conditions simply aren’t compatible. Therefore, while you can &lt;em&gt;mix&lt;/em&gt; normative statements and factual propositions, you can’t &lt;em&gt;derive&lt;/em&gt; one from the other, because the conditions that make it valid to assert and relate and derive normative statements simply aren’t the same ones that you use for factual propositions, and vice versa. This means that to construct a rationally binding justification for a normative statement — i.e. a “true” normative statement, in whatever way that makes sense — one has to begin with normative statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presents a problem, of course: because of the type of things they are, normative statements are not things that can be found “out in the world.” Values simply can’t objectively “exist” “in” things, the very notion is fundamentally ontologically incoherent, and moreover the apparatuses by which we ascertain objective features of the world work by generating factual propositions, they produce things according to those standards of truth, standards completely unrelated to those of normativity. Even more importantly, the way that normative statements are “true” is not a way that can actually be perceived if someone disagrees with them, so they cannot be established to be indisputably and intersubjectively true in the way factual statements can be. They are simply the conclusions of rational justifications, but if you disagree with those justifications, there isn’t, directly from that moral reasoning, any consequence that can disabuse you of that notion if and only if those justifications are correct — whereas, if someone correctly comes to a factual proposition, and conveys it to you, but you ignore them, you’ll probably find out, by walking off the edge of the cliff they were telling you was there, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we can’t get normative statements from our experience of the world, and there’s no way to objectively discover them by means that can be shared with others, where can we arrive at normative statements from? If we are to conclude any normative statements, we &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; have some to begin with, but if we can’t derive them, where can we get them? Well, they just have to &lt;em&gt;be there already&lt;/em&gt;. The base layer of normative statements cannot be arrived at by other means than by sheer axiomatic assumption, lest you go into an infinite regress of justifying normative statements in terms of &lt;em&gt;further&lt;/em&gt; normative statements. Moreover, the only reason you could have for axiomatically asserting such binding normative statements is because you inherently, &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; them to matter to you — otherwise you could never give yourself any justification for why you should even care about them, since to do so would require further normative assertions. Thus, they have to bubble up, in a manner of speaking, from our own perceptual awareness, through the &lt;em&gt;interplay&lt;/em&gt; between our conscious mind and the world around us. This is how &lt;em&gt;values&lt;/em&gt; (statements about what is “good” or “bad”, what we like or dislike) come to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in order to arrive at normative conclusions, any reasoning must begin with values that are &lt;em&gt;already present&lt;/em&gt; in someone’s mind, values they already feel intimately as normative. Otherwise, they can continue to just ask “why should I care?” and at some fundamental level, unless you appeal to desires that they already have, you simply won’t be able to answer. This is why, once you drill down far enough, even the most devoutly moralistic interlocutor will eventually appeal to consequences they think you probably care about: you shouldn’t rape because it will have bad psychological effects on you, or others, or people won’t like you anymore, or you’ll go to hell — whatever. Without doing that, there actually isn’t any justification that you can give for why some norm would apply to someone else because fundamentally they’d have no rational reason to care. You would just be making all sorts of factual claims that have nothing to do with them, and claims about what you should and shouldn’t do that boil down eventually to axioms (usually &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; values, assumed implicitly).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, centrally, the only kind of justifiable normative statements are those that are based on a relation between someone’s personal and subjective desires, and the situation they find themselves in relative to those desires. Outside of that, no normative statements can justifiably be made binding on anyone, because if they don’t already feel them to be binding, they simply don’t have any reason to care, and no reason can even be given, apart from futilely appealing to &lt;em&gt;further&lt;/em&gt; normative statements. Of course, human beings generally share certain basic core desires and motivations, and often the same general situation — being embodied social creatures — so this allows some surmise, but the fundamental structure of normativity appears, to me at least, to be subjective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normativity is, in the end, then, not really “normative” at all: it is merely the exploration of what one finds important, desirable, valuable, and beautiful, as well as the opposite — trivial, undesirable, bad, and ugly — and the implications of that. A deeply personal process of coming to terms with the full extent of what one does and does not value, which requires personal life experience, meditation, and reflection, as well as an attempt to reconcile one’s values where they conflict. It is a process of reaching reflective equilibrium, being at peace with what one wants to see in the world. “Normative” statements are merely an expression of our  desires for the world, for ourselves and others, expressions of emotion and desire, commands and commitments. No one can decide for anyone else what their values must be; they can offer advice, perhaps point out contradictions, and they can state their own values in contradistinction or solidarity, they can even use normative statements to express that they will or will not, support or do not support, the other person’s values, but they cannot rationally argue someone to a fundamentally different set of values without reference to that person’s existing values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an insight I’ve extended to my ethics and my political philosophy rather quickly, I think. So far, however, I have not completely extended this fundamental insight to the rest of my philosophy. Primarily, the one area where this insight has not completely been integrated is in my epistemology. Up till now all of my work on epistemology has framed the discussion in terms of reducing epistemic risk being a normative requirement: unnecessarily complex theories increase your risk of being wrong, so they &lt;strong&gt;should&lt;/strong&gt; be avoided; things &lt;strong&gt;should&lt;/strong&gt; not be believed until the risk that they are true, and the predictive benefits of their truth, outweighs the risk that they are false. This is the epistemic framing I deployed in my previous essay, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.alexisdumas.org/2022/02/08/atheism.html&quot;&gt;‘Summa Atheologica’&lt;/a&gt; as well, to describe why I saw no reason to believe in any gods or religions, and why doing so was in fact a bad epistemic choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately, however, I’ve been questioning more and more the epistemic normativity I’ve been assuming. I have long embraced pragmatism and phenomenology as the core bases of my epistemology, meaning that the normative force of rationality stems from the practical considerations of our motivations and desires in interfacing with the world &lt;em&gt;as we experience it&lt;/em&gt;, instead of stemming from some absolute standard of transcendental truth which it is our duty to achieve. Yet I have still been assuming that only &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; kind of pragmatism counts — that is, the pragmatism of reducing the risk of being wrong. I have been treating the requirement that epistemology be “pragmatic” for achieving an individual’s goals as a reason to treat doxastic risk-reduction as an absolute goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with this is that it ignores that there are many other axes along which beliefs can help us achieve our goals and desires, and how the relative risks and rewards — and various other factors — involved in an individual’s life might drastically change the landscape of what beliefs are practical even &lt;em&gt;despite&lt;/em&gt; some beliefs being objectively more epistemically risky than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, I have been doing in epistemology what I long since abandoned as untenable to do in ethics: trying to come up with an objective and context-independent account of what will satisfy all people’s desires best, by taking a single aspect of the process of satisfying desires, and reifying it into a fixed absolute. This is simply an inconsistency, and one that needs to be rectified, because I have been assuming in a sense the exact same normativity for rationality that I reject in other philosophers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, philosophers have treated it as a normative duty to adhere to a transcendental truth, a set of rules for rationality, or a set of intellectual virtues, in a way that is perfectly analogous to how they treated morality. In fact, this is so clearly the case that theories of moral normativity have in some cases been derived &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; the duty to achieve pure rationality — as in the case of the Kantian categorical imperative, which he justified in terms of the absolute human duty to be rational even if it does not make us happy.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I rejected such duties as thoroughly unjustified, preferring to focus on the practical concerns of situated human beings interacting with the world around them, ostensibly leaving myself only hypothetical imperatives to work with, only to turn around and embrace the duty to minimize the risk inherent in one’s epistemology, ironically a strategy that may not actually be the right one depending on the individual’s &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; situation! To make matters worse, I recognize in all other areas of life and action that absolute risk-reduction is unnecessary, yet I chose to ignore this in my own epistemology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this? Well, primarily it was because I had in my head a false dichotomy: in my mind, the choices were either that we all had a duty to choose the beliefs that were most likely to be correct, or all beliefs were totally on even footing, one just as good or likely to be correct as another. Thus, although I accepted the rest of the tenets of perspectivism — that all of our knowledge is ultimately predicated on our particular perspective, that no one has access to the absolute truth unfiltered by the angle through which they view it, and that truth is best moved towards not by trying to objectively compare a theory to “reality”, but through a dialectic and comparison of many perspectives — I have up till now balked at the final view: that the truth-value of a belief (assessed, for me at least, through risk and predictive power among other things) may not actually directly correspond to its &lt;em&gt;worth&lt;/em&gt; to the person holding it. Yet, as Nietzsche says, “it is no more than a moral prejudice that &lt;strong&gt;truth is worth more than mere appearance&lt;/strong&gt;; it is even the worst proved assumption there is in the world” — that is, nowhere have I seen it proven that truth is of absolute value, nor can it be, because such a claim is in the same boat as the rest of morality: chopped off by Hume’s Guillotine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings me to the second subject of this essay: faith. If I acknowledge that there are other considerations that might weigh against the risk of accepting something for an individual deciding how to construct their epistemology, I must acknowledge that for some people, that risk might actually be worth it. To reiterate what I said before, everyone is different — the context of an individual’s life matters deeply to making such an assessment, and furthermore that context is one that will never be fully available to anyone else &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; that individual. Therefore, it is fully possible that someone might be justified in choosing faith over reason, and although that does not require anyone else to make that same choice, or even make that choice justified or rational for anyone else, and although it doesn’t overwrite the improbability of the belief, if they choose it willingly, as an expression of their intellectual autonomy, &lt;em&gt;I should not say anything on the matter.&lt;/em&gt; I should not because doing so would contradict the very values that I hold: people need space to choose for themselves what they will do and believe, according to their own minds, exercising their own autonomy, and me trying to paternalistically tell them what is and is not good for them, regarding epistemology as with anything else, is a fundamentally patronizing and autonomy-reducing move on my part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that faith is a good thing at all times. Faith is a very brave and very scary thing to embrace, and can lead you down some very dark paths as well as some bright ones, because it is fundamentally a risk. It is choosing to believe something based on will alone, to accept the risk of being wrong by going against the lack of evidence, and even the evidence against. Furthermore, some people do not choose faith willingly, knowing the risks, but are forced or tricked into faith by lies, deceit, or indoctrination that hide from them the true risks of their faith and the true rewards of leaving their faith. In such cases, being of a certain faith is just as much their decision as someone who’s been defrauded voluntarily made the decision to fall into the trick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither is this to say that I will never speak out against someone’s choice to believe something on faith. My choice to not say anything on the matter of someone willingly and voluntarily choosing faith for themselves stems from my personal value of individual autonomy, and as such, if that choice, although stemming from personal autonomy, serves to hurt the values I stand for, although I will admit that no one else need accept my values, and that their faith may still be rational, I will still stand against it. Therefore, if their choice to believe something is not simply a personal choice that imposes risk on their personal lives, but is instead something that substantially influences the lives of others, especially if it becomes something that &lt;em&gt;harms&lt;/em&gt; the lives of others, then I will speak out against it. Because, to my mind, for as much as it is anyone’s prerogative to choose the risks they will endure, it is no one’s prerogative to make others bear those risks unwillingly. This is why I rail against many religions: they do not just peacefully live their lives. They spread their restrictive, hateful beliefs, through lies and trickery, hurt other people, and take over the state apparatus. If that were not the case, I would and should have nothing to say to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, all that said, for some people, that risk &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; might be worth it. I’m not saying this as a vapid caveat either: I can genuinely see why someone might choose faith, and there are many beautiful faiths to choose, too. I know people who choose faith and are beautiful people even still!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do have one more thing to say on the matter of faith, however, despite the previous section. I think for many people it might be worth it to attempt to live without faith. That way, they can more accurately ascertain the benefits faith has to offer in comparison to a lack of faith. Many people have never tried to live without faith in something, because they have been taught that to do so is to choose depression, emptiness, meaninglessness, or even amorality. I’m not just talking about particularly indoctrinated Christians here: even mainstream secular culture is soaked in professions that having faith in something is beautiful and necessary and an important part of human life. This is simply not necessarily the case —— for some it is, but for some it is not, and I think chances are that the majority of people don’t &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; need faith, they just have never been taught how to live and enjoy life without it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus some people have attempted to live life without faith and found it unbearable when it need not be precisely because they were still operating on religious premises and expectations: they still expected meaning to be granted to them from outside themselves, in a sense, and to be constant and fixed, instead of an every shifting impulse of affinity from the core of their being. They still wanted to view themselves as created creatures, fitted with a singular nature and purpose, when instead they are creative nothings that change as soon as they come into being through the capacity for self-reflection, a wellspring of newness which can become through consistent choice and practice almost whatever they choose. They expect morality to be a set of transcendental laws inscribed in an immutable heaven somewhere, instead of an expression of their own values and meaning pushed out into the world. Leaving faith with these expectations is an exceedingly difficult thing to do; as Sartre says, the absence of god is actually extremely embarrassing for someone who wishes to remove her with few consequences to their worldview. If, on the other hand. you set these expectations aside, and embrace your own meaning and morality, the changeableness and immediacy of life absent the transcendent, absent faith, you may find that, if you give it a chance, it is invigorating, freeing even. Yes there is a certain amount of anguish to be found in the idea that all is permitted, and at the same time nothing is legitimated, that you are responsible to your fellow human beings and must answer to them for what you do, and cannot justify what you’ve done in terms of anything but your own desires and motivations. Yes there is a certain struggle with the absurd that takes place when one can no longer choose to rely on the special revelation of god for certainty in one’s knowledge as Descartes did. Yes, there is a certain abyssal nature to being able to choose one’s own meaning for yourself, every day and every hour, and letting it change and flow. But there is a grounding effect, a freedom to it, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you choose to return to faith? So be it, and I wish you as much luck as possible! Moreover, having first found your way out of all your unjustified beliefs, all your faith, and returned to the bare necessities for living in the world of your experience, if you choose to return to faith you can build back from a clean slate: the forest fire that burns down half the forest leaves space for new things to blossom, and fertilizer from them. Just as with all endeavors of philosophy, the process is one of questioning your foundational beliefs and assumptions, venturing out into the no-man’s-land of uncertainty, doubt, and untenable or incomplete beliefs, and then returning once more to stable, solid, pragmatic footing — perhaps to where you began from, just now with a deeper and wiser appreciation for what you believed, or perhaps to a new place entirely. One must progress, as Nietzsche’s Zarathustra said, from the camel, which bears all duties and received beliefs with dutiful patience, to the lion, which rejects all such traditions and duties, to (if you so choose, I don’t think this last step is necessary) the child, which willingly chooses and takes on its duties and beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, as well, when choosing which beliefs to have faith in, the criteria is no longer truth or risk, it is what makes you happy, what you find beautiful and inspiring to believe, what brings you comfort, and what does not harm others. Good things, things that make the risk seem worth it to you. In accepting that faith is what it is: a leap, a risk, a hope, you free yourself to choose beliefs that express who you are and make you happy. Thus, when building back your faith, you can choose to believe beautiful, kind, compassionate, interesting things — there is no need to return, for instance, to the horrid and judgmental dictates of Christianity or Islam. This is something I already see many people of faith doing: they are choosing to believe things that are expressions of their personality, and their inner beauty and compassion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-1&quot;&gt;4&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion: in renouncing the last aspect of unjustified normativity in my philosophy I have gained a new compassion and respect for those of faith who take it as a personal thing, who are willing to take a risk to believe in things for the sake of their beauty. This does not mean that I accept that the things people of faith believe are true; this does not mean that I don’t think faith is a risk, or that some perspectives are more likely to be true than others or more worth something than others. This does not mean that I believe all faiths are equal. Nevertheless, I find myself in a more nuanced position than I was before, and I am very happy that that is the case.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;— Quoted in &lt;em&gt;Budget of Paradoxes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-introduction&quot;&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like most atheists in my part of the world, I grew up Christian. My mother was a traditionalist conservative Christian, bordering on fundamentalist. My father was more loose with his Biblical interpretation, but remained a presuppositionalist — so, somewhere in the general vicinity of Jordan Peterson, although he had his theological views long before ol’ Lobsterhead became popular. I grew up taking more after my father in this regard; he had me read &lt;em&gt;A Christian View of Men and Things&lt;/em&gt; by Gordon H. Clark, explained to me on myriad occasions how secular morality, politics, and epistemology was without foundation in the absence of the &lt;em&gt;Christian&lt;/em&gt; god, and encouraged me, when I rejected creationism, to reconcile evolution with the Bible (or, more accurately, reconcile the Bible with evolution).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was this focus on the apologetic and theo-philosophical aspects of religion that eventually led me to leaving the faith. I became increasingly interested in the aspects of philosophy that weren’t theological, and through that, became aware of the myriad schools of thought that based morality and epistemology on things &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; than gods. Eventually, I began to deconstruct my worldview’s reliance on the Christian god as a cornerstone, began to learn about the actual origins of the Bible. The orientation of my worldview began to turn on its head: now, instead of God justifying epistemology and logic, they were justifying God. At that point, the only thing that held me to my faith was the belief that “Judeo-Christian values,” and the morality that the Christian God justified, were necessary to a happy life and a stable civilization, and that, furthermore, such an argument from consequences was a valid reason to believe something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What finally gave me the push necessary to become an atheist was realizing that, after all, the morality espoused by the Bible, and the Christians that followed its teachings, simply &lt;em&gt;wasn’t a morality worth holding on to.&lt;/em&gt; It glorified being weak, having faith, being altruistic, and being a servant. It encouraged pity and condescending compassion instead of anything positive. It weaponized guilt and shame to keep you feeling dependent on Jesus Christ and keep you in line. It told you that your entire life, personality, and interests should be bound up in it and nothing else, lest you worship “false idols.” It was a thought-virus. So, finally, one day,  while the pastor was not-so-subtly trying to guilt everyone into tithing, and telling them that having interests outside of the church was idolatry, I got up and walked out of the church, never to return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sparked an intense period of research and learning for me, as I began to immerse myself every more deeply in the reasons for and against the existence of god or gods, as well as the field of epistemology which provided the (often unspoken) foundation for such arguments. You see, now that I didn’t have an endogenous reason to want to believe that a god existed, I wanted to make sure that there wasn’t an exogenous, epistemological reason that I was missing, I wanted to make sure that my rejection of god was actually in line with the truth,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and not just the product of emotion the same way my belief in god had been. In the process, I formed and strengthened my understanding of almost every philosophical discipline, from phenomenology to ontology and beyond, read the works of many philosophers, engaged in reading many secondary sources, and took 12 college credits in philosophy (I plan to take even more).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this period and up until today, my beliefs have developed rapidly, and I do not believe that there will ever come a time when I am done learning or developing, as a philosopher or as a person. Nevertheless, despite what some religious people would have you believe about atheists and others who “deconstruct” their faith, there was always a consistent through-line, a logic and direction, to the path I was following, both at the time and retrospectively. I wasn’t merely bouncing around between beliefs at random, believing whatever I’d heard last. Simultaneously, however, there was a drastic process of maturation going on for me from ages sixteen to now (twenty), and it is still ongoing. Therefore, please do not view this essay as a final word, a capstone to my deconversion; instead view it as just another milestone, a step along the path, documenting a snapshot of where I was at a certain time. Looking back, I doubt that I will ever wholly disavow or disagree with what I say here; but nevertheless, I will grow and change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-a-question&quot;&gt;2. A Question&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, why am I an atheist?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very simple question and, at first blush, it deserves a very simple answer: because I have not found sufficient evidence to be anything else. Of course, just as in all other philosophical discussions, from here on out things become far more complex. A number of questions concerning this answer must themselves be answered before we can even begin to talk about what being an atheist means for your worldview and life, or the arguments against atheism that theists have millennia concocting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-why-evidence-is-important&quot;&gt;3. Why Evidence is Important&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;31-primacy-of-practicality-experience-and-simplicity&quot;&gt;3.1. Primacy of practicality, experience, and simplicity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first question that must be answered is this one: why should we require evidence to believe things in the first place? The core reason is that beliefs inform actions, and actions have consequences, both for the world and for ourselves. This is the epistemological pragmatist’s answer. If I believe something is true about the world, then that has implications for how I should act. For instance, if I believe that there is an afterlife wherein we will see those we love, I won’t feel that it is as necessary to reconcile with my loved ones in the here-and-now. If I believe that in the afterlife people will get their just reward, what reason is there to try to improve life, or push for justice, in this one? If I believe that guilt is something that exists between myself and a deity, instead of myself and my fellow humans, especially those that I have wronged, and that it is something that can be discharged through prayer and repentance instead of making right what I have done wrong with those around me, that has implications for those around me. If I believe that there is a god who judges everyone according to its own set of rules, and therefore that there is an eternal law which is going to be imposed on everyone, then I will believe that I am rescuing people from eternal punishment by spreading the word and convincing them to stop lifestyles and actions that I believe are going to be harmful to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, it is better to restrict a worldview to only the simplest set of assumptions necessary to accurately explain and predict our experiences of the world. This is for two reasons: first and foremost, our experiences are the things that we absolutely must wrestle with, the things that matter to us most intimately. They are what we &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt;. Anything outside of experience is pure speculation until it becomes a part of our experience; pure unreality, compared to the real, tangible reality that we face every day, the reality which we invented philosophy in order to help ourselves comprehend. Secondly, and almost as importantly, for every assumption, rule, entity, or brute fact we posit that is not directly necessitated by our experience, our chances of being wrong increase significantly. Every proposition carries with it, inherently, the chance that it will fail to predict or explain reality. And incorrect beliefs carry consequences with them: they might directly lead to incorrect predictions, or prevent us from predicting something; they might block of further avenues of inquiry that might improve our ability to wrestle with the world of our experiences, or they might incline us towards believing other things, only tangentially related, that might harm us. Therefore, in light of these two facts, it is better to constrain ourselves, wherever possible, to positing only that which is necessary make the world of our experiences coherent and predictable, to understand, comprehend, and navigate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;32-falsity-risk-and-seeking-out-truth&quot;&gt;3.2. Falsity risk and seeking out truth&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of this we can define “truth” in terms of a theory which would best explain  and predict the totality of all human experience for all time — essentially the “final” theory that all epistemology that has to do with aligning beliefs and propositions to the world of experience through observation, testing, and conceptual analysis (including, but not limited to, science) tends towards in the long run. Truth is therefore a spectrum: something is more true the better it coheres with reality, with what experience requires for us to believe, with that “ultimate theory”; something is less true when it is further away from that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we purposefully choose to believe something that is not as close to truth as we can come, or not analyze our beliefs to determine whether they are as true as we can make them, we are purposefully choosing to accept the risk that we are holding beliefs that will make us choose to do, or not do, things that, had we known the truth, we would rather not have done. Things that will hurt our happiness, and the happiness of others. This is what I call “falsity risk.” Every belief carries with it a falsity risk: the chance that that belief has of being wrong (determined by the amount of evidence for and against it, as well as its inherent improbability, determined by its complexity) multiplied by the severity of the consequences &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; it is wrong. That is why our lives should be an ongoing process of learning, maturing, and improving, as we try to minimize our falsity risk in light of the new evidence we see, while at the same time it is okay to choose to not learn about some things, and not worry about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that most theologically ‘interesting’ — that is, non-pantheistic, non-deistic — religions carry with them an extremely high falsity risk, because they make substantial statements about the way the world works, the way human beings work and what makes them happy, the way society should be structured, the way one should live, and more. This isn’t to use a reverse version of Pascal’s Wager, to say that one should not believe in religions simply because of the risks inherent in choosing to do so and turning out to be wrong. This is simply to say that choosing to accept a religion is a choice that comes with serious consequences, and so should be considered carefully and not treated with frivolity. It is something that should only be done if you think you are correct in doing so. We posit the material world only because it seems to be the best and most natural way to understand the phenomena of our experience; we posit that other minds exist for that same reason; we posit particles, and galaxies, and stars, only for that reason; why should the rules be different for things which influence our everyday choices and lifelong happiness far more significantly than the existence of virtual particles or Proxima Centauri?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-what-is-evidence&quot;&gt;4. What Is Evidence?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the process of answering this first question, we have also answered a few other questions — what truth is, for one, as well as why materialist atheism is the “default” position. The next question that must be answered is this: what, precisely, constitutes evidence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;41-defining-evidence&quot;&gt;4.1. Defining evidence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on what I said in the previous section, my answer to this should be clear: evidence is primarily constituted by experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply saying this isn’t enough, though. Experiences are phenomena which &lt;em&gt;mediate&lt;/em&gt; between us and the  mechanisms, ontology, and/or rules that generate them — they are not complete in themselves but exist in relation to other experiences, which then form patterns, which form the “fundamentals” of the ontology we build in our minds.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As such, we have &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; of things, but we have no direct connection, no immediate epistemic knowledge, of what the rule or pattern behind that experience and its relation with all of the others we have or will have, is. Therefore, we have no immediate knowledge of what to posit, ontologically, as a good theory to encapsulate that pattern. Therefore, experience &lt;em&gt;simpliciter&lt;/em&gt; cannot be direct evidence for whatever that experience seems at face value to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This distinction is similar to the Kantian distinction between noumina and phenomena, in that there is experience (what we get directly) and &lt;em&gt;something else&lt;/em&gt; “behind” experiences, a meta-layer; it is different, in that it does not presume that anything in particular exists ontologically, if anything. It does not say, for instance, that noumina exist in a 1:1 correspondence with the objects of our experience. Monism, atomism, pantheism, and simulation theory are all viable, among many others. Instead, the “noumina” of my philosophy are the patterns that exist between experiences, which we call objects or laws. These patterns are out of our direct reach, even though we have direct access to our experiences, for two reasons: first, because we do not have access to the totality of all experiences, and second, because understanding those connections is an interpretive game with infinite moves, so something in the space of interpretations must be chosen volitionally, we cannot just jump from experience to interpretation in a determined way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To expand on the concept of interpreting experiences a little: experience must be &lt;em&gt;interpreted&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;correlated&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;integrated&lt;/em&gt; to arrive at a belief about the nature of what caused that experience, and the accompanying implications concerning other (future, past) experiences. This is usually a simple task, since interpreting experiences in terms of what they most literally seem to indicate is usually sufficient in everyday life. Because of this simplicity, the process is nearly unconscious and transparent, so people frequently assume that they do not interpret their experiences, but that “direct experience” of something is simply evidence for whatever that thing seems to be. On a slightly more sophisticated level, since a face-value interpretation is usually enough, people assume that taking experiences at literal face-value is sufficient in all cases. Both of these assumptions are wildly wrong. Even determining what the literal, face-value interpretation of an experience is in the first place is an active choice, and not at all a necessarily determinate or obvious one, instead influenced by background priors, education, and so on. So choosing what the “obvious” or “face value” interpretation of an experience is is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; interpreting it in terms of the background set of beliefs and experiences you have that set your priors for that interpretation higher than for others!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we have to choose an interpretation for experience, what should we choose? I propose that if we want to posit a pattern, rule, or object behind experience, we should do so on the basis of which interpretation provides the best predictive and explanatory power for that experience with the least complexity, assumptions, and logical lacunae (paradoxes, etc). This goes back to my pragmatic approach to epistemology: the &lt;em&gt;goal&lt;/em&gt; of positing things based on our experiences is to better figure out how to interact with and prepare for the world of experience that we have to wrestle with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, however, in choosing an interpretation we &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; have to consider how well that interpretation is able to account for the previous experiences that we’ve had, as well as the inherent improbability of that interpretation. This is what I call the &lt;em&gt;prior&lt;/em&gt; of an interpretation — its inherent probability combined with its prior success in explaining other phenomena within its purview. Thus, if a theory is very good at predicting some experience I just had, but is very bad at predicting other experiences (either because it positively predicted things that did not happen, or predicted that things that did happen would not, or, most importantly, if it is reconcilable with all states of affairs and so predicts any particular state of affairs with a one over infinity, that is zero, chance) then I would be justified (depending on how those balance out) in interpreting an experience in terms of a theory that does better on its prior probability even if it predicts the current experience with less probability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, then, having integrated all of the considerations in the previous paragraphs: experience is evidence for a particular theory if and only if it is better predicted by that theory. However, having evidence for something does not mean you should automatically believe that thing; you have to weigh the evidence and intrinsic improbability for a theory against all of the other candidate theories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;42-cases-of-indeterminacy-and-meta-theories&quot;&gt;4.2. Cases of indeterminacy and meta-theories&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In talking about theories and explanatory power, it might come across like I am saying that, should you come across something that your current web of beliefs cannot explain and/or did not predict, you are absolutely required to posit some new entity, and therefore that any unexplainable phenomena you come across is free license to posit any new entities you wish. This is not precisely the case. Although when unexplainable and unpredicted phenomena come about, you are required to integrate &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; new into your web of beliefs to account for it, it is sometimes acceptable to simply accept that the answer is not known without switching your web of beliefs or worldview completely. This is what I call epistemic indeterminacy: responding to an inexplicable phenomena by admitting that you do not have a direct theory to explain this compatible with your starting priors, but based on other knowledge you have, you are fairly confident that a wholesale revision of your priors isn’t necessary, and that the explanation, when found, will fall in line with your existing priors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is often the response you get from scientists and naturalists when they interact with spiritual people, people who believe they have seen UFOs, etc. While they do not perhaps have a specific explanation for these phenomena, they are confident that there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a naturalistic explanation, just one they haven’t precisely found yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two conditions under which such a framing is reasonable. The first is when the general outlines of an explanation — such as that a person is mistaken, had a hallucination, is schizophrenic, etc — can be provided, its just that the specific details are uninteresting and not perfectly accounted for because the theory remains in broad strokes. Here, the substance of the issue is predicted within the bounds of existing priors well enough that the priors don’t need to be changed, and on the basis of that substantial success, it can be extrapolated that the same success will be met with if one were to dive into the details, and its simply not worth the effort of doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second condition is one in which not even the broad outlines of an explanation is known, but the skeptic looks at the history of investigation of similar phenomena and notes that in every case they turn out to be explicable by natural means, and notes that on the basis of that evidence, they should have a strong expectation that this phenomena, too, will be explained naturalistically.  Thus, although they do not have a &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt; explanation for the phenomena, they can be fairly confident, on the basis of evidence about the the interpretation of past related evidence, that it is probably explainable naturally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these are instances of &lt;em&gt;meta-theories&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. theories about theories. Since you don’t have the evidence or theories at hand, or can’t/won’t go into the often grueling and extensive effort of debunking a particular one, you are instead theorizing about what theories would turn out to be preferable given the proper investigation, given evidence about how previous investigations went. Instead of theorizing to explain the evidence, you’re theorizing about the theories that would explain the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We actually do this a lot, every day. When we hear a disturbing noise at night, we don’t investigate it every time; we look back in our memory and remember all the times we heard a scary noise and it turned out to be nothing, and theorize that, given the proper investigation, the theory that would explain the noise best would turn out to be non-threatening, so we act as if it is, in fact, non-threatening. This is also what we do when we see things that are likely to be scams, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;43-personal-religious-experience&quot;&gt;4.3. Personal religious experience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In speaking so much about phenomenological experiences as the basis for my epistemology, I have surely pricked up the ears of those who have had personal religious experiences. If experiences are so important to you, they ask, what better reason could one have for believing in things of a religious nature than religious experience?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this, I reply that religious experience can only constitute a good reason or evidence to believe in a new class of entities (spiritual beings, for instance, or gods) if that experience cannot be explained in terms of the entities one is already committed to believing in. It is the first duty of someone looking to find an accurate and simple theory to explain their experiences, and avoid falsity risk, to attempt to reconcile their experiences with their existing belief commitments; only if, after attempting to do this, it becomes clear that their worldview cannot predict such experiences, and can only be post-hoc adapted to them, or that the experiences cannot be reconciled with their existing worldview at all, is it prudent to posit new entities in order to explain those experiences. I have yet to encounter any religious experiences which, even when recounted according to the people who had them, would provide sufficient reason for &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; to posit new religious entities, still less for me to. Not to mention the wide variety of religious experiences that means that any acceptance of a literal interpretation of them would be contradictory with the literal interpretations of many of the others, which &lt;em&gt;in turn&lt;/em&gt; is problematic for anyone trying to accept their religious experiences but not others, since now they have to explain other people’s religious experiences as not real, but make an exception for their own — &lt;em&gt;after having already demonstrated how it is possible to explain religious experiences in general by materialistic means.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this said, however, I actually do not deny the possibility that, if someone has consistent, frequent, powerful, and inexplicable religious experiences, it might be rational for them, in an attempt to live in the world as they experience it, to accept the existence of religious entities. After all, the primary goal of my epistemology is to allow people to live in the world that they experience, as they experience it, instead of holding them to dogmatic presumptions about how it all must work. Although we may all technically live in the same “world”, since we all interact, we also all live in different worlds, as we each have different perspectives and life experiences, and that can rationally change, even drastically, what we should believe even given the same epistemology! Nevertheless, I have never yet come across someone who actually described a set of religious experiences that would require such religious belief, and even if I did, it still would not require &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; to change my priors, as usually the experiences of others are also explicable in terms of naturalistic priors, and I simply do not share their experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-arguments-for-theism&quot;&gt;5. Arguments For Theism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of that out of the way, I think a brief look at some of the more compelling arguments for theism is worth it before I proceed to talking about what the implications of being an atheist are for one’s life. It is important to look, at least in broad strokes, at these arguments because the atheist is making a claim: that they have, as of yet, not seen sufficient argument or evidence to convince them that positing a god or gods is necessary to explain reality. As such, when given the time, outlining responses to the more common arguments that people might think of in response to this is simply doing one’s due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next three sections, therefore, I will briefly (but I hope with a fair amount of philosophical rigor) cover what I consider to be the three most challenging and interesting arguments for theism. I chose these specific three not just because they are challenging and interesting, but also because I believe they each exemplify a unique way that people try to slot god into their epistemic model, and therefore, through my responses, I will get to discuss the various ways in which atheism is a superior fit for those purposes. That way, you’ll get a more multifaceted understanding of my approach to atheism. For instance, the presuppositionalist argument highlights how someone might try to use god as a justificatory tool, to arrive at certain desired consequences which seem unreachable otherwise. The fine-tuning argument highlights an attempt to use god as a scientific theory, presenting the simplest explanation for the organization of the world as we see it around us. Finally, the Kalam cosmological argument highlights how we might use god to arrive at some sort of metaphysical grounding, and as an explanation not for the whole world as we perceive it, but for a particular event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;51-presuppositionalism&quot;&gt;5.1. Presuppositionalism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;511-the-argument&quot;&gt;5.1.1. The argument&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will first begin by tackling the presuppositionalist argument, since that is the form of apologetic that I started out believing. The presuppositional argument comes in many different forms, from the one that started with Van Til and Bonson and was most recently defended by Sye Ten Bruggencate, to the version defended by Matt Slick, to the version proposed by Gordon H. Clark, to that defended by Jordan Peterson. Fundamentally, however presuppositionalist arguments generally take the following very similar form:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;God is needed to justify X (meaning, morality, epistemology).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;X is practical/necessary/important.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Therefore, we need to accept god even without evidence for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;512-cutting-out-the-middle-man-and-avoiding-special-pleading&quot;&gt;5.1.2. Cutting out the middle-man and avoiding special pleading&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental problem with arguments of this form is that if positing a god is ultimately unjustified, then how can it provide good justification for the further proposition we wish to justify? If the justification of something relies ultimately on a baseless assertion, then in what way is that a good justification? If committing myself to believing something requires, as a prerequisite, that I accept something that I have no reason to believe, then it would be better, and more accurate, to simply reject that which relies on that baseless assertion! Of course, this is where the second premise in the argument kicks in: the presuppositionalist will retort that I simply &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; reject proposition X, since that would make my worldview completely incoherent and unlivable, so that move is simply not open to me in this exchange. The counter to that, however, is to point out a subtle trick that’s being pulled here: when the presuppositionalist introduces premise 2, they are essentially making the necessity or practicality of the idea do the work of justifying it, &lt;em&gt;not god.&lt;/em&gt; It is the incoherence of thought or impossibility of life without that proposition that forces me to accept it. God is just being “brought along for the ride,” so to speak, through the association of the two in the first premise. Therefore, the correct response to the presuppositionalist is to point this out and say: if we are going to rest the justification of X on its practicality or necessity, &lt;em&gt;simply let that be so.&lt;/em&gt; Admit that it is not justified in the argumentative or logical sense, but only in the practical or transcendental sense, and cut out the middle-man entirely. So it is impossible to reason without logic — that in itself is a reason to accept logic, no god needed! Ultimately, it is the proposition, X, that is doing the justifying of god, but since god and X are not conceptually related &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt;, but only correlated in the mind of the presuppositionalist, X does not strictly entail god, and the two can be decoupled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, an obvious response to this is to refer me back to the first premise: god is &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; to justify X. So if we want X, we can’t simply presuppose it, we have to presuppose &lt;em&gt;god&lt;/em&gt;. Unfortunately for the presuppositionalist, this is simply special pleading. They are already trying to use the idea that presupposing things is valid in order to presuppose their god, but suddenly they want to stop anyone else from doing the same thing, because when other people try to do the same rhetorical move, suddenly it becomes inconvenient for them. Problematically for them, however, there is nothing inherent to the nature of god, or X, that means that only god can be presupposed and nothing else can be, or that X can’t be presupposed, it can only be justified in terms of a presupposed god. Anything, I repeat, &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; can be presupposed. That’s inherent to the nature of presuppositions. It’s just that some presuppositions are worse than others, and we probably want to keep our list of presuppositions down to the smallest and least ontologically heavy (full of rules and implications) list possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;513-knowledge-meaning-and-spiritualism&quot;&gt;5.1.3. Knowledge, meaning, and spiritualism&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of reasoning this argument out might be in order. Let’s start with epistemology: suppose the presuppositionalist says that in order to know anything, we have to trust that god beams the knowledge that our senses are trustworthy into our heads in a trustworthy manner. This is how Descartes solved solipsism, after all, although he did not on this basis turn it into a transcendental argument. Without believing in god, therefore, the presuppositionalist insists, we cannot trust any knowledge that we have of anything outside our own heads, because we do not have a trustworthy source of information. In response, I might simply reply: why not simply believe, as a matter of practical necessity, that our senses are typically trustworthy? If you are justified in merely asserting that fact with an extra step, why am I not justified in asserting that fact directly? In fact, I don’t see why I’m &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; justified in asserting that fact directly due to its direct practicality than you are in asserting that fact with extra assumptions and indirection!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to mention the fact that presuppositionalists typically try to loop their scriptures into this argument at some point, thereby undermining their entire point; after all, if in order to know that god was telling them (trust-worthily in its omniscience and omnibenevolence) that their senses were reliable, they had to &lt;em&gt;read scripture&lt;/em&gt; first, then of course &lt;em&gt;prior&lt;/em&gt; to that (both temporally and logically), they had to trust that their senses were accurate enough to be competent to read scripture in the first place. Which could of course be false — an evil demon could be manipulating scripture to make it seem like it said one thing, when it really said another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same sort of reasoning works for meaning or purpose as epistemology: if meaning and purpose in life are really so necessary that asserting them baselessly is acceptable, then doing so with less indirection is both more honest, and more justified, than asserting them with more indirection. Additionally, if you are choosing for yourself whether to assert a god, and which god, in order to get to a certain purpose in life, you are essentially, at least in the vaguest outlines, choosing your own meaning for yourself anyway — so why not choose it for yourself directly? I guarantee that having control over your own life-narrative, your own meaning, will, once you have discarded the religious brain-worms of “true meaning” needing to come from outside yourself, make you far more fulfilled and happy, since you will be able to choose something that is truly the most meaningful to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also, incidentally, my response to the semi-presuppositionalist arguments that I often see from “spiritual” people. They object to what they perceive as my cold and calculated rationality — when it is really my warm blooded and excited love for experience and the world and the life that I am living! — by saying that they find meaning and purpose in believing in the spiritual world, and that it doesn’t really hurt anyone. To this I reply threefold: first, if you have the kind of epistemology that lets you believe such things merely because you want to believe, then you will be ripe to be taken in by all sorts of nonsense; second, if you are accepting something purely for the meaning it gives you, why not just construct and assert your own meaning directly; and third, I am sure that believing in those spiritual things makes some practical difference to how you act, so that the falsity risk of being spiritual remains non-zero. Nevertheless, typically people who are pantheists, spiritualists, pagans, etc, tend to be very accepting people with beliefs that are not particularly normative at all beyond conclusions that you would come to anyway, so I find it best not to bother them; the falsity risk of their belief systems is typically very small, and they are typically great people, so there’s no need to harass them unnecessarily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;52-fine-tuning&quot;&gt;5.2. Fine-Tuning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;521-the-argument&quot;&gt;5.2.1. The argument&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fine-tuning argument is a much more scientific argument then the presuppositionalist one, and actually follows the form of a proper argument, instead of an appeal-to-consequences fallacy mixed in with two special-pleading fallacies and a massive violation of Occham’s Razor. In this case, we have an abductive argument:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The universe is fine-tuned for life: there are many physical constants and laws which could have been otherwise, that have been set just right for life to exist.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The probability of this happening randomly is very small, since the range of possible constants and laws is large and they would have to be identical in value to the ones we currently have.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, the probability of the physical constants and laws being as they are given a god is one — guaranteed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Therefore, a god is the best explanation for the current state of affairs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;522-why-god-is-not-a-simpler-hypothesis&quot;&gt;5.2.2. Why god is not a simpler hypothesis&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental problem with this argument is that it hides all of the complexity of having a deity that would create the universe in just this way behind the seemingly-simple word “god.” You see, the reason that we would choose the god hypothesis to explain this over simply saying that the physical constants and laws that we observe are brute facts, is because that seems like positing a lot of brute facts, whereas if you posit a god, that’s only “one” brute fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with this is that the god that you need to posit for this to work is actually an incredibly complex &lt;em&gt;network&lt;/em&gt; of incredibly complex brute facts. While the physicalist is positing nineteen numbers and two rules (the standard model and general relativity, lets say), all of which we actually observe, the theist is positing that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;disembodied minds are possible and the spiritual world exists&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the god is omniscient&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the god is omnipotent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the god wants life for some reason&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the god chose to create a universe for the purpose of creating life, instead of just making more disembodied minds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the god chose to create a universe mostly uninhabitable for life, despite creating it for the purpose of holding life&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the god decided to create the universe with these laws of physics instead of other ones&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the god decided to create a universe that would need to have its constants and laws finely balanced against each other to produce life, instead of just creating life by fiat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a lot of brute facts, and the more theologically interesting you want your god to be, the larger the number of brute facts grows — and its not just about the number of brute facts either. Not only are these brute facts &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; things that we know exist and observe, and are very useful for explaining other experiences, but these are complex brute facts that carry with them a lot of implications, possibilities for contradiction, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note also that in order to explain why that god created the universe in this way and not some other way, we basically needed to &lt;em&gt;import&lt;/em&gt; all of the brute facts that the atheist would have to assume anyway? That basically defeats the entire point of this argument, showing that once again, in apologetics god is usually something smuggled in, an extra middle-man between us and the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; solution to the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to mention the fact that we don’t actually know how many of these physical laws and constants would need to be brute facts, and how many actually can be derived from each other or from further, more fundamental physics that we haven’t discovered yet. Already in history the number of fundamental physical constants has been reduced, as new science has shown how to derive previously thought to be fundamental constants from other ones, and we haven’t even gotten to quantum gravity yet! It could be the case that there is only one law, or one constant, that we need to posit as a brute fact, whereas the theist has already reached the limit of their exploration by positing a god.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, a god is just simply a &lt;em&gt;worse hypothesis&lt;/em&gt; than positing the physical constants as brute facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;53-the-kalam&quot;&gt;5.3. The Kalam&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;531-the-argument&quot;&gt;5.3.1. The argument&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kalam Cosmological argument is conceptually very simple, but it, too, has complications. Here is the basic format of the argument in all its iconic glory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everything that begins to exist as a cause for its beginning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The universe began to exist.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Therefore the universe had a cause.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;That cause is god.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Therefore, god exists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has the form of a more traditional deductive argument, and as such, we can analyze it premise by premise, unlike the previous two arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I do that, however, I think an abductive analysis of this argument, like the one given in the previous section, might be helpful as a high-level overview. This argument works by extending rules that we are familiar with in everyday life (or at least, so it claims) to another event in the set of all events, thereby seeking to establish that a god exists by showing that a god is actually &lt;em&gt;implied&lt;/em&gt; by are already-existing understanding of how the world works. Thus, god is being used to explain a new phenomenon, but by way of explanations, patterns, and rules that we already adhere to. This is the rhetorical power of the Kalam: it attempts to naturally integrate god into the totality of our scientific worldviews, treating it as an endogenous consequence instead of an exogenous extra hypothesis. Of course, the failure condition for this argument, then, is to show that either the event that is supposed to require god as an explanation by our existing rules didn’t happen, or, alternatively, that the existing rule it is relying on does not actually naturally extend in the direction the Kalam claims it does, meaning that new things would have to be posited, after while point it should become clear that positing a self-existing block universe is far more ontologically frugal than positing a universe &lt;em&gt;plus&lt;/em&gt; a self-existing god.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;532-the-universe-didnt-begin-and-it-didnt-need-a-cause-either&quot;&gt;5.3.2. The universe didn’t begin, and it didn’t need a cause either&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Premise 1: Everything that begins to exist has a cause for its beginning.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even granting all of the other premises of the argument for the moment, for simplicity’s sake so that we can tackle them one at a time, this premise has several serious, pretty much fatal, problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first problem is that extending this causal rule to the universe itself (and therefore to a state of affairs “outside” the universe, whatever that means) is actually extending it far beyond what everyday empirical experience and scientific investigation would suggest. We know that when an object “begins to exist” it requires a cause &lt;em&gt;inside the universe&lt;/em&gt;, where space and time and laws of physics hold sway, but we do not have any way of knowing that the same rule is true of a completely and utterly different situation. That’s stretching induction much too far. On top of this, it seems clear — and this is actually the consensus among both scientists and philosophers — that causation is a fundamentally spaciotemporal affair: a cause must come before its effect, and be related to it in some spacial, physical way. That gives us strong &lt;em&gt;prima facie&lt;/em&gt; reason to doubt that the principle of causation applies outside the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fundamental distinction between what happens inside the universe, where even the vacuum of space, which is colloquially called “nothing,” is actually filled with a manifold with all sorts of energy and activity going on, and known laws, and what happens “outside” the universe, where truly nothing that we can really comprehend exists, defeats the naive intuitionistic argument that if it were possible for something to come into existence without a cause, and from nothing, then we would expect to see it happen all the time in the real world. Not to mention the fact that even if this distinction did not rebut that argument already, we could simply say that things springing into existence is cosmically rare — so rare in fact that we would not expect it to happen within the time that human has to exist. This is in fact what quantum physics leads us to believe: even in a vacuum, virtual particles pop in and out of existence causelessly all the time, and these particles have a certain probability of not mutually annihilating each other, in which case, it is possible, just astonishingly unlikely, that &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; could pop into existence at any time. Thus, rejecting this rule, whether totally, or only in its application to the universe, does not require us to accept absurdities at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second problem with this premise is that it equivocates on the definition of “cause.” Both in the sense that, as explored in the foregoing paragraphs, whatever kind of cause would work outside the universe would have to be a &lt;em&gt;very different&lt;/em&gt; kind of cause than the ones we are familiar with, but also in the sense that, when we are within the universe, every cause we have ever observed has both a material and efficient component, whereas if something were to “cause” the universe, it would of course have to be &lt;em&gt;immaterial&lt;/em&gt; in nature, which is something that we have never seen before. In fact, we don’t even know if it is possible, or have any reason to think that it is! Thus, again, the process of induction that the Kalam is trying to leverage breaks down just precisely when we get to the very boundary that it is trying to stretch to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following on with this problem, another problem arises immediately: from our experience within the universe, we know that matter cannot be created or destroyed, only rearranged. When new things “come into existence,” they are really the materials of other things being arranged into a new pattern that we recognize as a new entity. Therefore, if inductively extrapolating rules of things inside the universe to the universe itself and beyond is valid, then why not extrapolate that rule, and conclude that the universe must have always existed, since we know from experience inside the universe that matter and energy are constants that cannot ever either come into existence or go out of existence? This actually meshes well with our understanding of the Big Bang, since as far as we know the matter and energy that expanded into the universe as we know it today has always existed, and the current universe is only a different state and organization of all that matter and energy, nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, one argument that can be made in response to what I’m saying is that we know that everything in the universe needs a cause to begin to exist, and since the universe is just the set of all those things, surely whatever applies to every member of the set, also applies to the set itself. The problem with this argument is that it commits a parts-to-whole fallacy. If I say that each brick in a wall can’t function as a wall, therefore the whole set of bricks cannot function as a wall, well, that is obviously mistaken. How do we know this is not the case with the universe itself? It could be possible that the most fundamental metaphysical law is that “Nature abhors a vacuum,” and &lt;em&gt;some set of things must exist&lt;/em&gt;, it is just that any &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt; thing doesn’t need to exist; so particular things need causes, but &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt;thing will always exist no matter what, without the need for a particular cause. It should also be pointed out that the universe is actually not merely the set of all things; it is actually a separate and unique thing itself which &lt;em&gt;contains&lt;/em&gt; everything else. The universe is the spaciotemporal substrate that everything else exists embedded in, and that substrate is very decidedly some&lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Premise 2: The universe began to exist.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, yet again, we come across severe difficulties. The first major problem is that we don’t actually know that the universe began to exist at all. We know that it is not past-infinite, but because of how we believe time works during and around the time of the Big Bang, we have reason to believe that time itself only began to exist along with the universe’s expansion. That would mean that although the universe is finitely extended in the earlier-than direction, there was no time at which the universe did not exist, because there is no infinite “container of time” for it to be embedded in that would allow for a state of affairs when it did not exist. It never “began to exist,” it &lt;em&gt;always was&lt;/em&gt; — it just changed state at the beginning of visible cosmic history. This is not overturned by the Borde-Guth-Vilenkin Theorem, either, whatever William Lane Craig might tell you: all that theorem proves is that a universe which is expanding cannot have done so forever. It does not prove that there ever was any point in time when that universe did not exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason this is important is that if something has always existed, at all points in time, then there really isn’t any coherent way in which we can say that it “began to exist.” To say that the universe began to exist, when there was no point in time at which it did not exist, is simply to redefine words. So to try to apply a causal principle, which has to do with “beginning to exist” in the sense that we mean when we see things in this universe not exist and then come into existence, to something which can be said to begin to exist only in an extremely different and distinct manner, is to equivocate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second issue with this premise is that it assumes a tensed theory of time, where things in the future and past do not actually exist, only the present infinitesimally small “moment” exists. Thus, when something that did not exist in the past begins to exist in the present, there has actually be an ontological change in state — a new entity has entered the picture. If this were not the case, if all moments in time were equally existent and real, than anything could be said to “come into existence” only in the sense that a ruler “begins to exist” at the first inch — that is, the appearance of starting to be present is not an ontological fact, but a product of a reference frame that is limited in scope and accelerated through the time dimension in a certain direction. The problem with assuming a tensed theory of time (A-theory), however intuitive it might seem, is that the B-theory of time, or block theory, is pretty much universally considered to be the only theory of time reconcilable with the physics of relativity by modern scholars in both scientific and philosophical disciplines. All attempts to reconcile relativity with an “objective” reference frame in order to allow time to be tensed, such as the Neo-Lorentzian relativity theory, have failed, so we are left with strong reason to think that the very concept of anything “beginning to exist” at all, except in a sort of relative sense based on our own reference frames, is just irreconcilable with science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you change the argument so it isn’t about the universe as a whole “beginning to exist,” but instead is about the state transition of the universe starting to expand needing a cause, it really doesn’t work. We already know that things can require state transitions, or various effects to happen, from their internal nature, without an external cause needed. A perfect example of this is radioactive decay: simply because of the nature of large, heavy atoms, they will begin to change their state, without any external cause needed. Why could it not be like that for the universe? Simply the existence of so much matter and energy compressed into an infinitely tiny space, &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt; expansion to take place — and since, as far as we know, that matter and energy existed timelessly before it began to expand (if that even really makes sense), there isn’t even a question of why it started to expand at one time or another — &lt;em&gt;as soon as it existed it began to expand&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sub-conclusion 3: Therefore, the universe has a cause.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum up then, based on the previous points: we have no reason to think that something coming into existence &lt;em&gt;ex nihilo&lt;/em&gt; actually requires a cause,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and applying causal principles to the universe is fallacious; we also have no reason to think that the universe actually did come into existence out of nothing or begin in any other sense that might require a cause either, and we have no reason to think that the eternally (for all of time, even if time itself is finite) existing universe required an external cause to begin expanding either. These objections in themselves, completely annihilate this sub-conclusion, and therefore the rest of the argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is more to say, perhaps not surprisingly at this point. It could be objected that whether the universe actually &lt;em&gt;temporally&lt;/em&gt; came into existence or not is a moot point, because what the Kalam is really getting at is that we have to posit god as the ultimate sufficient reason or ontological substrate that contains and necessitates the universe — a sort of contingency argument. The problem with this argument is that in &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; worldview, you’re going to have to posit a brute fact, as the chain of reason or logical causation is going to have to end with &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; no matter what. The theist chooses to posit god as a brute fact, while the naturalist chooses to posit the universe as a brute fact. The question is — which is a better approach? I believe that the answer is quite clear: positing the universe as a brute fact is by far the superior approach, because it elevates a reality that we all have to grapple with, the source of our experiences, to the highest position in our ontology, where it should be. Furthermore, it posits no more entities than those which we already have reason to believe exist, and posits a quite simple entity at that. Meanwhile, positing a god as a brute fact doesn’t really have any extra explanatory power (see the previous section), elevates something that we don’t have reason to believe exists independently to the top place in our ontology, and is quite complex. The only possible reason we could have to prefer a god over a universe as a brute fact is the ontological argument, but that argument basically says that god is a brute fact as part of building its definitions, so its not really lightening the load at all, and it also fails as an argument.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Premise 4: That cause is god.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll just cover this argument briefly, since, having destroyed phase one of the Kalam, phase two is pretty much irrelevant. The common argument given for the cause of the universe being god is that, as something which causes the universe, it must be atemporal and immaterial, as it must exist outside of the universe and prior to it. So far that’s reasonable, but it doesn’t rule out abstract laws of physics, quantum fields, etc. What comes next is where things really start diverging into absurdity: proponents of phase two of the argument insist that for something to cause something without being caused to make that choice itself, that thing must be a personal agent. This relies on the assumption of agent-causation, where conscious, personal agents are the sole cause of their decisions, with nothing prior to them causing their decisions ultimately. First of all, this is a highly contentions understanding of free will, and I think it should be pretty obvious that most ways we understand minds require context and prior causes in order to make decisions. Moreover, I would argue that minds are &lt;em&gt;fundamentally&lt;/em&gt; temporal — the operation of thoughts is a temporal affair, and something which simultaneously holds all mental states isn’t really doing thinking. I also think minds are fundamentally material, or at least relational: consciousness requires something to be conscious of, so a mind cannot exist in the absence of something to exist in relation to. Furthermore, I simply don’t think that agent-causation is the only way you could get uncaused causes. See my points about radioactive decay and the inherent nature of objects requiring new events without direct causation above. See also Richard Carrier’s stuff on refuting the “out of nothing nothing comes” argument. Finally, we arrive at the idea that whatever this cause is, it must be “sufficiently powerful to create the universe.” This is tautologically true, since whatever caused the universe must have the causal power to create the universe; but the picture that proponents of this argument want to draw for us, of something having to be immensely, incomprehensibly powerful in order to create the universe, simply doesn’t follow — effects can be disproportionate in scope to the “size” or “power” (nebulous terms) of the causes that create them all the time, e.g. the Butterfly Effect. The reason it seems like we should assume that the cause is extremely powerful because it has the power to create the universe is that there is an equivocation here between &lt;em&gt;causal power&lt;/em&gt;, the logical and metaphysical capability of causing something, and power in a broader, theistic-associated sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;54-pascals-wager&quot;&gt;5.4. Pascal’s Wager&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All my talk of falsity risk in the opening sections might have brought to mind Pascal’s Wager, and my clarification of the differences in how I am applying probabalistic epistemology that I outlined there might not have satiated the reader’s appetite, since they may still believe that that sort of approach to epistemology entails, despite whatever I may think, the correctness of Pascal’s Wager. Therefore, before I move on, assuming that my audience is satisfied that I am reasonable in my atheism, and establish what I think the correct implications of atheism are for human life, I think it is necessary for me to delve more deeply into why Pascal’s Wager is incorrect even given my epistemology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t lie — when I first came across Pascal’s Wager, its logic was so similar to my own mode of thinking that it really threw me for a loop, and it took me about a week of really struggling with it to internalize an intuitive understanding of the fundamental problems with it so that it no longer bothered me. I hope I can convey those reasons here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;541-the-argument&quot;&gt;5.4.1. The argument&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic form of Pascal’s Wager usually begins with a simple Bayesian table, like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;-&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Atheism&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Theism&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;God&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;\(-\inf\)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;\(+\inf\)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;No God&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;\(+n\)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;\(-n\)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put it in words: if you choose to not believe in god, and it turns out that god exists, you will go to hell for all eternity; whereas if you choose to not believe in god and he &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; exist, you only gain a finite amount. Meanwhile, if you choose theism, and god does exist, you gain an infinite amount, whereas if you choose theism and god doesn’t exist, you only lose a finite amount. According to basic decision theory, the choice is obvious: on the one hand you have a finite reward with infinite risk, and on the other hand you have infinite reward and finite risk — because of the infinities it &lt;em&gt;doesn’t matter&lt;/em&gt; what the relative probabilities of theism and atheism being true are, the infinity overcomes them. The logical choice is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; to believe in god.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;542-naive-decision-theory-doesnt-work&quot;&gt;5.4.2. Naive decision theory doesn’t work&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One common objection to this argument is to deny doxastic voluntarism, and insist that it is impossible to simply &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; to believe something without sufficient evidence. This, of course, is true to a certain degree, but I actually think that at base level, belief at least &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be volitional. We can choose our epistemologies, and thereby we can choose what we believe by extension — to believe in god, we simply have to change our epistemology to be a much weaker, more permissive one. Of course, that raises the question of whether the belief one has in one’s own epistemic system is voluntary, and I’m really not sure that it is (probably isn’t), but the point is that this point is highly contentious, and verges into highly nebulous psychological discussions that I’m simply not interested in having. Furthermore, Pascal himself has a response to it: he says that whether or not we can choose to believe, we should at least try, on the off-chance that it actually works, or that at least pretending to believe is enough to make god happy. Which seems like a solid enough response to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, the more interesting response stems from a thought experiment, which highlights that there is a more fundamental problem with this argument, something extremely important missing from the naive decision theory that Pascal uses to make his point. Imagine you’re walking alone in a dark ally one night, when a mysterious stranger in a dark suit strides up to you out of the gloom. In the striated lights and shadows of the car headlamps passing on the road behind you, its hard to see his face, but his eyes glisten wetly in the moving light as they stare at you. When he speaks, he speaks in a low baritone, telling you that you are in grave danger. There are spirits haunting you, he says, and they will soon strike, sending you to the pits of Tartarus to burn for all eternity. To prevent this, good spirits have appeared to him in a dream, and told him that you must pay him a thousand dollars, as well as wear this medallion. He holds the medallion out, a strange twisted shape of gleaming lacquered oak. Do you pay him and take it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Pascal’s logic you should, without question — after all, if you don’t and you turn out to be wrong, you will burn for all eternity, whereas if you do, and turn out to be wrong, all you’ve lost is a thousand bucks. Yet, I daresay many of us simply wouldn’t take this man’s offer seriously. Why not? The threat of eternal punishment should surely outweigh whatever inherent improbability there is in the conception of the universe he is presenting to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the reason why we wouldn’t pay the strange man, or take Pascal’s bet, is that decision theory needs to operate on the basis of possibility, not mere conceivability. This is because while there are an infinite amount of conceivable situations — many of which are in fact &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; possible, and/or not compatible with the actual world that we otherwise find ourselves in&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; — we are beings with a finite amount of processing capacity, and we need to limit the range of what we have to consider when making decisions to the most salient, important, and relevant options. That process of determining what options are salient to our decision-making needs to be based on what we actually know about the thing with respect to which we are making decisions: the world of our experience. Thus, the options that are actually salient to our decision-making process are those options that have either been demonstrated to be possible by evidence, or can at least be inferred to be possible. We should therefore only enter outcomes into our decision matrix if they are demonstrated possibilities consistent with the actual universe in which we are making decisions. Spending all our lives considering every possible conceivable scenario with a large enough negative or positive payoff to overcome their inherent improbability (whether that payoff is infinite or not) is simply a waste of time, an exercise in needless worrying, especially since it is difficult to assess whether any of those scenarios are actually even possible given the actual universe we live in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, since we have seen car crashes in the past, we should integrate that into our understanding of the risks of driving, but since we have never seen someone be abducted by aliens while driving, even though that is a &lt;em&gt;conceivable&lt;/em&gt; occurrence, we don’t really need to worry about it. This is actually how people deal with anxiety all the time: realizing that some outcomes are simply imaginative flights of fantasy that have no real basis in what actually happens in the real world. Likewise, until it is demonstrated that a god actually does exist, and therefore that it is an actual possibility that a god exists, one need not consider that part of the payoff matrix. Of course, if it turns out that a god &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; exist, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; Pascal’s Wager actually have something interesting to say: out of self-interest, we should try to get into heaven even if we don’t like that god!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can perhaps give a somewhat stronger illustration of why this limitation on decision theory is necessary by bringing up the “many gods” objection to Pascal’s Wager. This objection merely points out that if infinity obliterates all consideration of relative probability, then we should not just consider the Christian god, but &lt;em&gt;all conceivable gods and religions.&lt;/em&gt; Not merely all existing religions, but every god that is conceivable. Now, I think it is fair to say that there is an infinite amount of conceivable gods; even if we limit the properties of these gods that we vary to create the space of possibilities to the conditions for entering heaven or hell, since that is what is relevant to the Wager, we can still construct an infinite number of them, since for any god, we can create an anti-god that sends you to hell if you believe in that &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; god, and an anti-anti-god, and so on, essentially working like the Peano arithmetic “successor” function, which provably creates an infinite set. Once you have this infinite list of gods/religions, we can match each god up with an infinite list of other (mutually exclusive) gods that will send you to hell for believing in that god, meaning that you have a negative payoff of an infinity of infinities for choosing any god, matched against the single-order infinity of positive payoff for choosing that god. Therefore, the expected payoff of choosing any god in particular remains infinitely more negative than positive. Any choice we make, therefore, is the “wrong” choice, because we have to consider the conceivably infinite consequences of being wrong!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atheism isn’t the odd one out here, either. There are many belief systems that grant infinite reward (heaven) to those who stick to truth no matter what and follow their conscience, whether or not they believe a particular thing, and grant infinite punishment (hell) to those who are disingenuous about what they believe, or hurt those who believe differently from them (which most of the religions that most assiduously threaten eternal damnation encourage you to do). In fact, such belief systems are quite common among those that are generally spiritual or agnostic. That’s not to mention the belief systems that grant you infinite reward (heaven) no matter what you believe, like (some forms of, if I understand it correctly) universalism, which means that any belief system you choose automatically has an extra infinity granted to it (and constant multiples of infinity are not differentiable, above adding one infinity where you had none before, so this still does not privilege theism over atheism).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if we were to take seriously the logic that, according to Pascal’s Wager, it is rational to be &lt;em&gt;anything but&lt;/em&gt; an atheist, there are other decision-theoretic paradoxes that crop up, further demonstrating that doing decision theory on conceivable outcomes is simply naive. For instance: if there is an infinite reward for believing, should you simply do the minimum necessary to be counted religious, since that has the same expected payoff (infinite) as doing any more? Or should you do the absolute maximum (become a monk perhaps), since you want to do everything in your power to avoid that infinite negative outcome? Should you choose the religion with the worst hell (in order to avoid it) or the worst heaven? These are all fundamentally and completely unsolvable decision-theoretic lacunae once you incorporate conceivability into your decision tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this illustrates the fundamental point: once you admit conceivability into your decision tree, all hell (if you’ll forgive the pun) breaks loose. Thus, we should only really worry about established possibilities for consequences when trying to decide our actions. Let us worry about living the &lt;em&gt;one life we know we do have&lt;/em&gt; as best we can; we’ll find out what lies beyond that, if anything, when we get to it. As Nietzsche said in &lt;em&gt;Thus Spake Zarathustra&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I beseech you, my brothers, &lt;em&gt;remain faithful to the earth,&lt;/em&gt; and do not believe those who speak to you of otherworldly hopes! Poison-mixers are they, whether they know it or not. Despisers of life are they, decaying and poisoned themselves, of whom the earth is weary: so let them go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads us directly to falsity risk: falsity risk, rather than being a reason to believe in something based on the possible consequences of not doing so, is instead a reason to &lt;em&gt;investigate&lt;/em&gt; and try to form &lt;em&gt;correct beliefs&lt;/em&gt; about something. It is essentially a barometer for deciding whether to investigate whether something which is conceivable is also possible. Additionally, like I discussed earlier, falsity risk only works as a reason to ensure that one has a sufficient reason to believe something, and does one’s due diligence regarding it; it does not work in the negative direction, asking one to have sufficient reason to disbelieve something, because if we started on the prospect of believing absolutely everything in order to avoid that risk, we would have to believe an infinite number of contradictory things, which is impossible. Therefore, of the two poles, I choose the one that begins with the null hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-living-like-an-atheist&quot;&gt;6. Living Like An Atheist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright then — I’m an atheist because the world as I experience it does not provide me any reason to be otherwise. What does that entail? How do I choose to live, what values do I choose to posit, how do I grapple with all the things that religion provides for other people? I think these are questions worth answering, especially answering in a mature and developed way that is aware of the philosophical literature surrounding existentialism, because far too often all that is presented is a negative atheism, an atheism that only says “no” and nothing more. That is strictly acceptable, but it isn’t satisfying. I think if you try to demolish people’s worldviews without offering anything in return to substitute it — either a reason why they don’t need something, or something to fill that need — they will be far less likely to actually accept what you are saying and change their minds. It’s like interacting with someone at a brainstorming session — alright smart guy, maybe my idea &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; bad, but what’s yours?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nietzsche worded this question the best, in the full version of perhaps his most famous quote, from &lt;em&gt;The Gay Science&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall  we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest  and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death  under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there  for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred  games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too  great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that the answer to Nietzsche’s final question in this quote is a resounding &lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt; — if by a god we mean a being that decides values, erects morals, chooses the purposes of all things in the universe, and chooses the meanings of categories by which things are interpreted, then I believe that, in the absence of a god above to us to do those things for us, we must choose to do them for ourselves. Thus, the old objection to atheists that many theists make — that we just want to ignore god in order to become our own gods, is partially true, just backwards; we want to become our own gods precisely because we have lost our faith in the gods we believed in before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what does this new landscape without a god look like? What does it imply, about the choices we make and the things we believe? Unlike many atheists, I believe that a worldview without a god should actually be drastically different in character and meaning from one with a god; in this, I agree with Sartre, when he said, in &lt;em&gt;Existentialism Is A Humanism&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It is nowhere written that ‘the good’ exists, that one must be honest or must not lie, since we are now upon the plane where there are only men… Everything is indeed permitted if God does not exist, and man is in  consequence forlorn, for he cannot find anything to depend upon either  within or outside himself… If God does not exist, we are not provided with any values or commands that could legitimize our behavior. Thus  we have neither behind us, nor before us in a luminous realm of values,  any means of justification or excuse. – We are left alone, without excuse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, while I am of the opinion that it is just as “legitimate” to assume by faith and dogma whatever values we please on the basis of nothing but our own voluntary choice and desire, and elevate them to the level of commandments, as it is to use that voluntary choice and desire to justify a god which in turn justifies those commandments, as I said in the section on presuppositionalism, nevertheless, I do not want to be merely just as justified in my choices as the theist. I want to be more justified, and more free. I want to free myself from faith and dogma, and choose my values as they come to me through my desires, without externalizing them into a code which I must bow down to. That is, I want to become Nietzsche’s overman, Stirner’s willing egoist, one who proclaims her values and desires boldly and unapologetically, who declares them and denies all duty. Another quote is reasonable here, I think. From Nietzsche:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My brothers, why is there a need in the spirit for the lion? Why is not the beast of burden, which renounces and is reverent, enough?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To create new values — that even the lion cannot do; but the creation of freedom for oneself and a sacred “No” even to duty — for that, my brothers, the lion is needed. To assume the right to new values — that is the most terrifying assumption for a reverent spirit that would bear much. Verily, to him it is preying, and a matter for a beast of prey. He once loved “thou shalt” as most sacred: now he must find illusion and caprice even in the most sacred, that freedom from his love may become his prey: the lion is needed for such prey.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But say, my brothers, what can the child do that even the lion could not do? Why must the preying lion still become a child? The child is innocence and forgetting, a new beginning, a game, a self-propelled wheel, a first movement, a sacred “Yes.” For the game of creation, my brothers, a sacred “Yes” is needed: the spirit now wills his own will, and he who had been lost to the world now conquers the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must deny that there is any duty, claim freedom for ourselves, and then, in the space that freedom creates for us and our individuality, understand and will the values that our dear to us, enact them, pursue them, love them and the world we exist in. Thus we embrace the freedom of nihilism, the rejection of any inherent or objective meaning, without falling into the despair that might come with that realization if we forget that subjective values, our own values, need not be justified, and do not need objectivity to be worth pursuing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the fundamental danger that looms over those who reject religion and the religious-like secular values that most atheists accept: if we still retain the same basic misconception that reason must be the master of the passions, that all that we do and choose must be based in reasons and objectivity ultimately, then we are bound to fall into despair, as we realize that no passions, no values, no purposes can ultimately be justified in terms of objectivity. We will abandon all hope, and abandon the pursuit of beautiful things that we love. To avoid this, we must come to realize a fundamental truth, one that Hume realized long ago: reason is not the master, but the servant, of the passions. Reason is a truth-preserving mechanism, a means of re-arranging axioms and truths, of relating them; we cannot ask it to do anything more; therefore if something is not implicit in the premises that we give it, we cannot expect to find it in the conclusion. Hence if we do not &lt;em&gt;begin&lt;/em&gt; with passions, with desires and values, we cannot expect reason to &lt;em&gt;produce&lt;/em&gt; desires or values! We should not ask of reason something which it cannot provide. Instead we should live life by passion alone, by love alone, and allow reason to fulfill its proper function, of reconciling values and helping us achieve them. We should look within ourselves, and figure out what is meaningful to us, what is beautiful to us, what we desire and value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And why not? Why is this not superior to that which religion can provide? I see no reason why I should not find meaning that stems from the very depths of my soul, the very core of my being and nature as a person, that wells up from the wellsprings of who I am, that I had to search through high mountain cliffs and deep caves to find, more beautiful and meaningful to myself than a meaning selected for my without care for the particulars of my individuality and personality by a being other than myself! I do not see why the fundamental freedom to choose one’s own purpose in life, as well as the values that one will enact throughout it, is not a freedom to be treasured, exploited, and pursued, enjoyed to the fullest. It is only the indoctrination of religion, that teaches you that you are nothing without it, that your whole being must be wrapped up in it, that meanings that are not “objective” are meaningless self-deception, that fools us into thinking otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, I would argue that even if God exists, even if religion were true, that would be of no help to us. A meaning, or a purpose, or a code of values and commandments handed down by a celestial being is no more objective than those things when handed to us by another person; they are merely the opinions and decisions of another mind, subjective as the opinions of any other mind. Values cannot exist metaphysically, to be found in the world, their ontological existence is incoherent and nonsensical. Yes, commandments handed down by a god are the product of a “perfect” mind, an “infinite” mind, but that does not make them any less subjective; yes, they are handed down by a being that is infinitely more powerful than us, but that gives us a reason to obey them only out of fear of punishment or the desire for reward — the same reasons that earthly law and nature can provide; the laws themselves are still the subjective caprice of a deity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, I understand that the freedom granted by atheism brings with it a huge responsibility, an “anguish,” to use Sartre’s term. It is no light thing to accept, I admit that — but is any truly foundational belief a light thing to accept? No! And is it worth it? Yes, a thousand times yes! The freedom that not belonging to someone else, not being the slave of some metaphysical tyrant, brings is immeasurable. Thus, when the theist tells me that I am an atheist because I just want to sin, they are partially correct — I do want to sin, I &lt;em&gt;enjoy&lt;/em&gt; sinning — &lt;em&gt;and who wouldn’t?&lt;/em&gt; Who would not rejoice to be free of the arbitrary rules and limitations of religion, who does not, deep in the core of their being, the part of them that still revels with Dionysus in the woods, love the good things of life and want to enjoy them? Who does not want to meet others in love and passion, to taste the fruits available to us in this world? Who, in other words, honestly does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; want to be a hedonist? It is only the first part of their question that I reject: I reject the notion that I believe or disbelieve things only because I want to believe them; that is pure projection on the part of the theist, for that is the purview of faith alone. If there is an unpleasant truth, and there is something I can do to avoid it, even if at great cost to myself, &lt;em&gt;I want to know.&lt;/em&gt; Claiming otherwise is like saying that you would rather &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; know that there is a truck barreling down the road towards you, which will crush you unless you stop playing in the street, simply because it is an unpleasant truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I say here may seem to lack specifics, it might seem empty of specific injunctions to you, but that is precisely the point. For myself, I choose hedonism as my life philosophy, anarchism as my moral code, and the exploration of truth and beauty in writing, as well as the furtherance of the causes of justice and equality, as my purpose. But those are my choices. I believe that every person is better off when granted autonomy, and prefer to see true liberty for all; I hate relationships of domination and subordination, where the interests of those involved are not treated as truly equal; I hate authority and hierarchy; so I choose to be an anarchist. I love life, I love experiencing life, and I prefer to plan rationally and carefully so that I can enjoy life as much as possible, so I am a hedonist. I love writing, and thinking, and helping others, so I choose the purposes listed above. But these things will be different for everyone. I believe there are general reasons, applicable because of the situation we find ourselves in as conscious agents and a social species, that some values will be better than others for promoting happiness, but that is all. I will not dictate to you what you must choose, because that is simply the reinvention of religion. All I will do is try to guide you to what I believe is most probably the truth. After that, go and be free. Become your own god.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-conclusion&quot;&gt;7. Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that is why I am an atheist, and what I make of my life in light of it. To summarize, I think that being an atheist is the natural outcome of an epistemology oriented around pragmatism and trying to maximize one’s chances of being correct. Therefore, I think it is both the most correct, and the most pragmatic, position to take regarding religion. Additionally, I view it as a fundamentally freeing position to take, one that allows you to live authentically, as you choose, as a fully autonomous being not beholden to anyone above you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I rarely speak about my lack of faith. I do not evangelize atheism. If someone seems open to converse on the topic, I’ll sometimes engage them if they bring religion up, and if someone close to me converts I might ask them why they converted and try to explore the reasoning with them, in the hopes of at least coming to understand where they came from, and either learning that they have a rational reason, or getting them to reconsider if they do not (which, meta-theoretically, is more probable); nevertheless, I am not in the business of going out and trying to deconvert people &lt;em&gt;en masse&lt;/em&gt;. Why is that, if I believe atheism is most probably correct, and also beneficial for your life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, it is because if someone is not harming or likely to harm others, and is not currently or immanently in danger of harming themselves (as opposed to just missing out), I want to give people space to believe what they think is right and discover the truth for themselves. Trying to make sure everyone thinks correctly about things when the only person they’re hurting is themselves (or no one at all) is simply annoying and invasive. Moreover, I can’t be absolutely certain that I am in fact correct, so it’s better to foster a diversity of ideas and consider them all carefully. Furthermore, it isn’t my responsibility to make sure that everyone is a perfectly rational thinking machine. Most important, however, trying to debate someone into a position you hold &lt;em&gt;simply isn’t a good way of convincing them.&lt;/em&gt; Especially if it’s a position that is integral to their identity and worldview, like religion is. Instead, I try to do as Paul suggests: present a compassionate, happy, example of someone living without god, so that those around me know that it is a viable, non-evil option. Exposure to good atheists, kind atheists, is probably the number one way that people who already have doubts about their faith will deconvert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I find writing about philosophy enjoyable, which is why I’m writing this: not necessarily to convince anyone, but because its nice to get my ideas out on paper.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;This leads to a fun little paradox, in that experience is both the fundamental component of reality, because it is the most real thing we experience and the fundamental starting point for everything, and the least fundamental component of reality, since it is always explained in terms of something else. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the history of epistemology there was, for a fairly long time, a fundamental split between rationalists and empiricists. The rationalists believed that certain knowledge about the external world could be arrived at purely &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt;, through rational thought, using only the categories and intuitions that are inherent to the mind. The empiricists, conversely, believed that humans were, to one degree or another, born as &lt;em&gt;tabula rasa&lt;/em&gt;, and that our understanding of rationality and intuitive concepts is shaped through experience as we grow and explore the world. The pure versions of both these theories of knowledge formation have severe problems, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since Hume pointed out that even such basic concepts as cause and effect could neither be directly derived from experience nor proved by rational thought, and Kant pointed out that making sense of the world required basic categories to be in place in the human mind prior to experience, pure empiricism has fallen out of favor. Modern science has continued this trend, by showing how perception is shaped by neural structures which are predetermined to develop within certain bounds and in certain general directions even before anything is experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, however, pure rationalism has a crucial and insurmountable problem: we have no fundamental assurance that whatever intuitions or beliefs we have about the operation of the world outside our heads are correct. There is no direct, infallible connection between our minds and the metaphysical state of mind-independent reality, and we are often wrong about things because of that. Historically, in fact, our intuitive beliefs about how physics, nature, and the cosmos work have been &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; wrong &lt;em&gt;the vast majority of the time.&lt;/em&gt; This means that simply relying on the content of our own minds to divine properties of reality outside of us is a fool’s errand. It might work, and it might not, and we have no way of knowing. Whatever rationalistic justifications we can come up with for pure rationalism working would themselves rely on the unjustified assumption that our intuitions about metaphysics and ontology are correct, and would necessarily be externalistic accounts about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; things work instead of justifications anyway. The only connection we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have to the world outside our head — or at least the only one we &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; we have, because we are forced to deal with it — is our senses. So instead of ignoring the one (if unreliable) way of accessing objective reality we have access to, in favor of a speculative alternative connection, it seems much more &lt;em&gt;rational&lt;/em&gt; to rely on the one method we know we have. Thus we get Kant’s distinction between &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; knowledge, which can tell us about our concepts and minds, but nothing else, and &lt;em&gt;a posteriori&lt;/em&gt; knowledge, which can tell us about the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These approaches to epistemology are, however, mutually exhaustive. There are only two sources of belief for human beings: internal intuitions and thoughts, and sense experience. Therefore, we know that the correct approach, if one is to be found, must exist in the space between these two extremes. Although it is not based directly on rational justification (or even meta-justification), but instead on considerations of practicality and existential thrownness, my pragmatic epistemology ends up endorsing just such a compromise between these two theories. However, unlike most compromises, which tend to synthesize the thesis and antitheses that were in conflict either by letting them take on different roles or combining them, my theory of epistemology chooses not to resolve their antimony, instead allowing them to exist in tension, both contributing to the same areas of my epistemology, just from separate poles. I call this a “dyadic” approach to epistemology, because it allows two mutually equal things to exist in tension, but also communication, with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following sections I will examine how first the empiricist part of my epistemic dyad, and then the rationalist part, contributes to the whole of my epistemology, and then how they feed back into each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we have the way in which the empirical part of the dyad substantiates the rational part:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The universe, as a mind-independent source of experiences, does not owe us comprehensibility or meaning; there can be no guarantee that simply because rationality is a necessary prerequisite for us to be able to comprehend a thought, a sentence, or an experience, the universe must adhere to rational principles. Therefore, we are stuck in a difficult position: we have no choice but to rely on the modes of thought and pattern-matching that we have been given, but at the same time that choice is inherently a risk. This is the fundamental gap between thought and reality that empiricism, with its steady documenting of the sensory experiences we have of the universe, can help close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Empirical experience of the effectiveness of rationality, mathematics, etc, can give us reasons to continue relying on those faculties, by reinforcing that, at least so far, although there is no absolute guarantee of their reliability, they have been reliable nevertheless. Although rationality is something that is needed prior to experience, to give it form, continued experience reinforces rational concepts, and our trust in rational thinking. The millions of everyday guesses that you make, based on rational inference, about things like how much food you have left, or where you left your car, or even more basic ones like object permanence, continually reinforce and lend credence to your trust that rationality, although not inherently or necessarily connected to the universe, will continue to be useful for understanding and interacting with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an insight that the empiricists themselves had, but they took it to mean that rationality was derived from experience &lt;em&gt;ab ovo&lt;/em&gt;, which cannot be the case, as I demonstrated in ‘Logic and Mathematics.’ Nevertheless, they &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; right that most of the “reason” that we &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt; rationality — if not the reason that we &lt;em&gt;use it at all&lt;/em&gt; — is due to this repeated experience, and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; due to any innate characteristic of itself. The fundamental insight that dyadic epistemology brings is the separation of the reason that you trust something and the reason that you use something: you can use something because you are forced to, because you have no other tools at your disposal, or because you cannot help it, or from a combination of all three, and then later, through experience, come to trust that tool that you are forced to use. This is the part that empirical experience has to play in substantiating the rational aspect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we have the part that the empirical dyad has to pay in allowing us to arrive at knowledge about the universe at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This role was already described when I explained why rationalism cannot work by itself: our only known and unignorable method of interfacing with mind-independent reality is through our senses. As such, while it might be possible that we can also gain information about reality through our intuitions or &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; categories, I have never yet seen this satisfactorily substantiated, and in fact I don’t think it &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be substantiated except through conformation with the senses, which means that the senses are still going to be the primary means of gaining information about the universe. Even the rationalists do reasoning in their heads, draw metaphysical conclusions about the world, and then operate in the world as if those metaphysical conclusions are true, and it is that operation within the world, that interaction with whatever is outside our heads in our daily everyday lives, and with our experiences, that the “rubber meets the road.” That is what we ultimately care about the most, and so that is the true test of the correctness of a premise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could look at it this way: it is a general rule of argumentation that whatever is not present in your premises, cannot be present in your conclusion. A rational argument is merely a synthesis and rearrangement of the information contained within the premises, nothing more, after all. Therefore, if what we ultimately want to learn about is how to interact with the world as it presents to our senses, because that is the part of our experience that is most clearly from outside us, most clearly unforgiving, and which dominates our experience of life, then beginning an argument with no premises that are from the world of our sense experiences, one cannot conclude anything about the world of our sense experiences, and so rational arguments will be perpetually, if not trapped within our own minds, at least trapped within the our mental life. This is the fundamental insight that I talked about in ‘An Introduction to the New Pragmatism’: if we want to deal with something important, we go &lt;em&gt;look at that thing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, while rationality is required for comprehending and using the information that we gain from sense experiences, sense experiences are an &lt;strong&gt;equally necessary component for gaining knowledge about the world.&lt;/strong&gt; In essence, knowledge is like fire: just like fire requires oxygen, heat, and fuel at once, knowledge requires both rationality and sense experience — empiricism — at once in order to form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of this, repeated experience is actually a very profitable way to learn what modes of reasoning are more likely to be reliable than others, and to develop a more acute sense of what constitutes accurate reasoning. Some reasoning may seem correct on the face of things, but if over time we notice that it does not lead reliably to good results, we can gain confidence that that mode of reasoning is not on the same level as others, and begin to treat it with more suspicion. This is, fundamentally, how we arrived at an understanding of the logical fallacies: reasoning that has informal logical fallacies can actually be correct and properly entail its conclusions with reasonable certainty, but this is a rare case — in most cases, reasoning that uses informal fallacies does not entail its conclusions with the same assurance that other forms of reasoning can, and that is why we view reasoning that contains such fallacies, without additional reasoning to support the use of them, with suspicion. The key point, though, is that informal fallacies are not “wrong by definition” in terms of the criterion for meaning, and they may appear correct on the surface in most cases they’re used, even if they’re usually wrong, and so it is actually by a process of learning through experience and dialectics, and not by pure reason, that we learned to identify them, and thereby augmented our ability to reason accurately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing on with this analysis, let me explore further why rationalism cannot be completely reduced to empiricism. Fundamentally, this is because an understanding of how to derive meaning and patterns from experience cannot itself be something that is completely learned from experience, since to do that learning you would &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; have to have a way of deriving meaning and patterns from experience. Therefore, the structures that allow us to cut the world up into objects, understand object persistence, derive concepts and categories, and understand the patterns and relations between all of these things have to be ready in the mind, waiting for the first experiences to come in to be processed through these myriad lenses and correlated into a coherent picture. This is backed up by modern science, which documents just a tiny fraction the extensive amount of processing that the brain does automatically for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without the ability to recognize that portions of sensory experiences that occur regularly together are probably related, whereas ones that can occur together and apart with relatively equal frequency are not, we would not even be able to form concepts for singular objects, since our understanding of what an object is fundamentally relies on the understanding that a certain set of experiences (shape, color) will tend to happen together, and a certain set of further experiences will tend to happen when actions are taken in the presence of the first set (touch, interactions of various kinds).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without the ability to relate things on the basis of the range of sense experiences we attribute to them (their properties), in the sort of latent space of properties that we position objects and categories within, so we can recognize particulars, ranges of particulars that belong to categories, categories that intersect, and subcategories, then, again, our ability to parse out the meaning of the experience we have evaporates. After all, the ability to divide the world of our senses into objects and classes of objects is what directly allows us to establish more advanced concepts such as causal relations, since causes and effects are always necessarily between two particulars, so we have to build categories for causes and effects out of the particular causes and effects that we see so that when we see a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; particular, we can guess at its effects by finding the categories that it belongs to. For instance, whenever we see a ball bounce, it is in a different place, a different color, a different size, etc. If we couldn’t form categories of balls, and categories of actions of balls (such as bouncing), every time we encountered a new particular ball we would be surprised by the fact that it bounced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental dyadic structure of my epistemology works, in light of these considerations, like this: both sense experience and rational categories are equally necessary for forming knowledge about the world. Our rational faculties provide a means for structuring the world around us and deriving information from our experiences of it, while our empirical faculties provide the information that our rational faculties require for their processing to produce conclusions about the world, and also give us reasons to actually &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt; our rational faculties. Once this basic process of learning about the world has been initiated, moreover, a feedback loop begins: through empirical experience, not only is our trust in our rational faculties increased, but we gain experience about which methods of reasoning are more accurate and new tools to use. This increase in the depth and accuracy of our reasoning capabilities in turn increases the rapidity and accuracy of our ability to learn from empirical experience. Thus, the tension between rationalism and empiricism is converted into a mutually supporting, mutually amplifying, system.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alexis Purslane</name></author><category term="epistemology" /><summary type="html">Author’s Note: I recommend you read at least these two previous articles on my epistemology before you dive into this one: ‘An Introduction to the New Pragmatism’ and ‘Logic and Mathematics: New Pragmatism and Conceptual Reasoning’ unless you are already familiar with my thoughts on epistemology from other sources.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Character of an Egoist</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2022/02/02/character.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Character of an Egoist" /><published>2022-02-02T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2022-02-02T00:00:00-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2022/02/02/character</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2022/02/02/character.html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably one of the most instantaneous assumptions that someone might make, after reading about &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.alexisdumas.org/2021/12/08/egoism.html&quot;&gt;my views&lt;/a&gt;, as a moral subjectivist and an egoist, not to mention a Nietzschiean, is that I am someone who holds to no principles, has no character, and simply does whatever I feel might benefit myself in the moment. To a certain degree I have already dealt with why that isn’t true in my first essay on the subject, since I pointed out there that a willing egoist, someone who knows and accepts that they are an egoist, is just someone who is conscious about the fact that the only motivation they have for doing anything is desire, and is no longer willing to accept phantom concepts that appropriate a part of their desires for use as a carrot or a stick to get them to fulfill duties and obligations that are primarily for the benefit, and the power, of others. It does not imply that one must only have self-reflecting desires, or that one must be a sadist or a psychopath whatsoever. Nevertheless, I think it would be helpful to explore in more depth why egoism, as I explain it, does not entail someone who is “evil” or without principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first point is that, obviously, if the desires that we act on are not required to be entirely self-regarding, then human beings, being social creatures, will naturally form desires concerning the well-being of the people around them. Egoism does not rule out natural trust and good feelings among people and communities, and extensive psychological and anthropological shows that when such feelings are not hindered, they naturally grow. Human beings are not inherently benevolent or malevolent, we are a complex mixture and intermingling of both, and what generally causes malevolent action is not the love for causing harm or the total lack of regard for others that is typically portrayed. Instead, it is when our natural social natures are suppressed by forming in-groups and out-groups, or dehumanizing people, or when we are forced by circumstances that are already alienating and degrading, that we tend to take anti-social actions. These can all be mitigated, both by socio-economic changes, but also by philosophy. As soon as the truth is ascertained and arbitrary distinctions built on tradition and phantoms but nothing more are cast aside, people typically feel a sense of comradeship for all other thinking and feeling human beings. This is both because we have a natural ability to feel empathy and compassion for other humans, and because if everyone around you is doing better, then that will benefit you as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, even if egoism does not &lt;em&gt;guarantee&lt;/em&gt; that someone will be benevolent, it certainly does not preclude it. Max Stirner himself said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I love men, too, not merely individuals, but every one. But I love them with the consciousness of my egoism; I love them because love makes me happy, I love because loving is natural to me, it pleases me. I know no ‘commandment of love.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, egoism does not even ask that those who are benevolent towards their fellow human beings tolerate those who are not. Moral subjectivism is not the same as moral relativism. Egoism simply asks that all act according to their heart’s desires, trying to see and think as clearly as possible. If you stand against something, and someone is doing that thing, &lt;em&gt;you may try to stop it&lt;/em&gt;, and others may try to stop you. So if you stand for liberty, equality, and justice (the balance of interests among equals), as I do, then if you see someone violating that, you do not need to wait for a blessing from on high or an objective argument to go out and stop that violation from happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, most people have beliefs about what kinds of societies it would be nice to live in, what is fair, and so on, and those need not be self-serving in an obvious way, especially since when considering a vision of society it is much more likely that your position in it will be random, or on the lower end of average, than that you will be in a position of power, so when advocating for a society it is best to advocate for one from behind a “veil of ignorance.” I for one would much rather live in an egalitarian society than a radically unequal one, because I know that not only would I be freer and better off in the sort of society that does not make one’s rights or well-being contingent on anything, it is unlikely I would end up in power or be able to maintain it, so it would be better to live in a society where there is a balance of power between everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are more reasons that an egoist can have for being benevolent, too. For one thing, an egoist must also live in human society, and in human society, reputation, trust, and reciprocal relationships matter enormously. If it is known that you are an individual who is likely to do, and capable of doing, anything at any given moment, merely because it seems to be to your advantage at the time — stealing, backstabbing, etc — then no one will want to interact with you, and you will likely be shunned by those around you. And those suspicions will grow around you even if nothing can be proven, if things just &lt;em&gt;happen&lt;/em&gt; to disappear when you’re around, for instance. Conversely, actually initiating and positively engaging in reciprocal, mutually beneficial relations with people and your community at large is often a very good way to ensure that those people will be ready and willing to do the same for you when you need it. Positive reputation and social relations are a totally rational investment, as well as something that will probably make you feel happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, building habits of acting in ways that are respectful of the interests of others and mutually beneficial for you and them will make acting that way, and resisting harming people (in the vast majority of situations in which doing so is not actually beneficial to you) that much easier. It lowers the cost of a range of actions that are typically more beneficial, useful, and rewarding, and lowers the cost of resisting actions that are more typically self-destructive. Therefore, building positive, pro-social habits is a incredibly rational thing to do, even for someone who is purely self-interested, not to mention a human being who naturally gains joy from the act of helping others and from being around the joy of others. And how do we form such habits? By acting in accordance with them regularly and with conscious intention, even when we don’t want to, so they get ingrained in us! Thus, as Aristotle says, the path to forming a good character is by consciously choosing to act in a good way. In this case, “good” here just means “useful for living a social life,” but the point remains the same. You shouldn’t turn forming these habits, or the habits themselves, into an absolute end-goal or commandment, but nevertheless, taking a somewhat virtue ethical approach to forming positive habits can be very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, one of the things that being a willing egoist does to you is make you more honest. After all, if you accept that the ultimate reason you do anything is because you want to, there is no more hiding behind duty, obligation, tradition, or authority. You must be honest with yourself and others, and others who accept that philosophy will see through any obfuscation you or anyone else attempts to throw up. If you harm someone, they will know, and you will know, that you either harmed them because you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to harm them, or because you &lt;em&gt;don’t care&lt;/em&gt; about harming them. No appeal to a greater good or a duty to king and country will excuse you. You are ultimately responsible to yourself and those around you, especially those you harm, and you must answer for what you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By mirror image, similarly, when you do something that benefits others, everyone will know that it is because you &lt;em&gt;wanted&lt;/em&gt; to, not out of some sense of obligation or altruism, and that will reflect better on you. After all, someone who does kind things because they love to do them, because they love other people, because doing kind things is natural and pleasing to them, is intrinsically a person that other people will want to be around more than someone who only does kind things because they feel they must, and groans at every giving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this is to say that a willing egoist would act just precisely like any other normal person. By  rejecting spooks, and choosing to admit and embrace the fact that we serve our own desires, we free ourselves from the ensnaring web of  culture, society, and authority. Egoists do not recognize any authority above themselves, either ideological, philosophical, or physical. They do not recognize legitimacy as something that some people have and some do not. They may play along with your institutions and your social concepts and means of control, but they do not ingest them and become owned by them.  These spooks that egoists reject the absolute domination of  include  religion, personal responsibility or worth, humanism, morality, civil  society, political participation, to name a few. An egoist may act or believe things that align with these concepts, but these concepts are under the egoist, tools they use or things they adopt and cast aside at will because they  identify with them, not all powerful sacred ideas that hover over their heads. By refusing to serve them unless they serve us, by treating them as rules of thumb at best, and discarding many of them as useless tools of control, egoists end up freer, more ready to achieve their true desires, more direct, and more decisive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a willing egoist might feel more dangerous and less predictable than an unwilling egoist, like a wild animal feels more dangerous and less tame than a domesticated one. That is just fine. Egoists are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; tame animals. But they are just as capable of love, and reciprocity, and all the good and protective and positive aspects of human relations and emotion as anyone else; perhaps moreso, because for them, it is more authentic.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alexis Purslane</name></author><category term="egoism" /><category term="ethics" /><summary type="html">1</summary></entry></feed>
