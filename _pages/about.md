> "Only great pain, the long, slow pain that takes its time... compels us to descend to our ultimate depths... I doubt that such pain makes us "better"; but I know it makes us more profound... In the end, lest what is most important remain unsaid: from such abysses, from such severe sickness, one returns newborn, having shed one's skin... with merrier senses, with a second dangerous innocence in joy, more childlike and yet a hundred times subtler than one has ever been before."

## About Me

Hi there! I'm Alexis, an amateur philosopher. I'm a mutualist (of the Carsonite left-market anarchist and/or individualist anarchist variety), with special interests in political philosophy, political economy, epistemology, phenomenology, and ethics (or the lack thereof, depeding on how you look at it). I'm also an existentialist atheist (along the lines of Sartre or Camus) and although I'm not dead set against all religion in theory (for instance, deism), I am generally anti-theist in leaning. I like to call myself a Luciferian, since I view the traits of Lucifer Morningstar, especially in stories like *Paradise Lost* to be admirable: indominable will, egoism, and anti-authoritarianism, a willingness to stand against tyranny against all odds, and a full self-acceptance and pride in one's own nature. I'm an egoist, as well, of the moral non-cognitivist/moral nihilist sort. I'm also transgender, bisexual, and polyamorous.

## About the Blog

I use this blog as an outlet to write down the various philosophy-related thoughts that I need to get down before they drive me crazy. There's no set posting schedule here, just whenever there's an interesting idea rolling around in my head that I want to explore, but I do post here pretty frequently considering the average post length. If you enjoy fairly rigerous philosophical musings and treatises, with a sympathy for French and German philosophy, you'll probably enjoy this blog.

## About the Name

This blog has gone by several titles since I started it, initially it was "The Brain-Damaged Philosopher's Blog," until I recovered from what I had thought, at the time, was permanent post-concussion syndrome. Then, after my egg cracked, I finally decided to change the blog's name. I tried out "The Gay Science" for awhile, but it felt too simple and not really indicitave of the nature of this blog, so eventually I settled on "Luciferian Loquations," which I think adequately indicates the general anti-theist and anti-authoritarian tendencies of my blog, as well as being more catchy.
